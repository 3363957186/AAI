Got the flolab one, but the fit on the 17 was odd, using the installer places the screen protector a bit high up on the phone so there’s a bit of a pronounced gap between the base of the screen and the start of the screen protector

I didn’t have the best of experiences with the Flolab.  First, I did have to work on many bubbles and one small one that initially did not go away.  Eventually, I got it worked out but I guess i expected more considering the price.  But my real concern, or warning for others is compatibility with phone cases.  When I installed the case I had purchased for my new IPhone 17 (not the pro or Pro max), it caused the sides of the screen protector to raise and ultimately most of the protector separated from the screen.  I quickly removed the case but as a result, the screen protector shifted and I had to reinstall it by sight.  That wasn’t easy.  Nonetheless, I still managed to encounter some dust and have not been able to dislodge it.  Again,  I am commenting primarily as a warning.   Ultimately, I purchased a Spigen case recommended in a sister video to this and that appears to be compatible.

I don't comment a lot on channels, However I will say that I purchased the iPhone 16 pro max version last year and it saved my bacon. I had dropped my phone and when I picked it up this past week, I had thought I cracked the screen right before my trade-in. This saved me big time. It was the best $40 I spent, considering a replacement front glass for the iPhone would have been around $379,  with no Apple care. I just purchased another for my iPhone 17 Pro Max.

Apple has invested $2.5 billion in a new partnership with Corning to develop and produce future iPhone cover glass, which includes a new Innovation Center focused on material and manufacturing advancements. This is a specific investment for future R&D and manufacturing, not the total annual R&D spending for all iPhone components, which was in the tens of billions of dollars. Previous investments in Corning for R&D include an additional $250 million in 2019 and $45 million in 2021.

Got the Flolab screen protector for my 17 Pro Max. Noticed the left side is covering a bit of the screen (maybe 1-2 pixel width). Noticeable with the keyboard up. They sent me a new one, but it was auto sent through the warranty. Not sure if the one coming will be any different.

I really wanted to go with flowlabs but rhey don’t make a 3D edge version yet for the 17 series except for the privacy version. I emailed them about it and they confirmed. From my experience have the earlier versions of the Flolab for the 16 pro max, they did fit well until they released their 3D edge version. It took them 3 versions to get it right. The 3D edge version fit perfectly. I’m baffled why they didn’t release that for the 17 series as the screen geometry is the same. I bought the Torras because it had that perfect edge to edge rounded edge fit.  But as your testing showed its AR is not as good and it locks the polarspectra feature which I love. Why Flolab?! What was the edge and fit like on the one you tested?

What about privacy screen protectors. Please make a video on this if you can. Love your videos ❤🎉

    my recommendation is to make your own
figured out you can take a piece of acetate (or a cheep glass screen protector if you feel fancy)  and stick a GEL anti glare screen protector on it  
IT HAS TO BE A GEL ONE (you can buy huge sheets for cheep)
you then have a removable and infinitely  reusable anti glare screen protector that sticks to your phone screen so you can still have a nice bright screen at home, but privacy outside
after about a week you figure out how to install it bubble free in about 5 seconds 
still works with no loss of responsiveness even with a standard screen protector already installed

I’m disappointed with the scratch resistance of the FloLab screen protector. Despite the high price point, mine sustained a deep scratch just from being in a pocket with a metal money clip. Since FloLab doesn’t cover physical wear under their warranty, I’m left with a damaged screen and a lighter wallet. At $40, I don’t feel the value matches the durability; there are much more affordable options that perform similarly.

    I bought the UltraGlass Unbreak for my 17 Pro Max based on that same video and I would say hold off for now. It’s so close to being great but 2/2 of the screen protectors have noticeable air bubbles on the right side outer-most edge of the screen. Like literally in the exact same spot both times I installed them. Also small air bubbles in either of the bottom corners. I followed their instructions and used the tool, but somehow it happened twice. My guess is that the installation tool and/or screen protector needs to be updated for the new phone. That, or their adhesive needs to improve.

Now I’m looking at the Torras OrigArmor since the Flolab is gonna get here by the end of October.

I used the glassgo on my iphone 16 pro max and torras case. dropped it a lot and changed screen protectors twice in a year. Sadly, the back cracked sometime and noticed it today. Decided to order the 17 pro, not the max, due to this issue (no applecare+) and that they actually greatly upgraded the telephoto camera on the iphone 17 pro. I don't care about the max having a bit more screen space and battery life at this point.

I'll sell the iphone 16 pro max with a cracked back. Sure, compared to just repairing it, I'd shell out 400 bucks more but I get the new camera, a supposedly sturdier back glass and I honestly think I'm tired of the max versions, I have the biggest ipad pro so if I truly want to watch a lot of videos, I'll use that, I rarely watch anything on the go.

I'd say the glassgo was fine on its own, even when it shattered after many drops on hard surfaces my iphone had zero scratches, but supposedly the origarmor has the benefits of curved edges and less glare so I want to test it. Kinda expensive, really, you get 2 glassgo versions with pretty much the same glass except the glare reduction and edges for a lower price than one origarmor. But I suppose it's fun to test out.

Was looking at flolab too but they seem to have deceptive warranty and it'll likely be annoying to get help in the EU. But, really, torras doesn't offer warranty at all. But I was buying my case from them anyway. Meh. Maybe I should've went with the standard one instead, far more economic, I'll see if it's truly worth it.

Got the flolab because of this review. I got the privacy screen protector, and its subpar. I’ve dropped it twice and it cracked after second time. I dropped my previous iphone 13 hundreds of times and never had to get my screen replaced. I dropped this one twice and already need a replacement. Honestly should recalibrate the review, also include Belkin kuz thats what apple is offering in store as well. The privacy screen is not that great as you can still see significantly from the sides at full brightness, and thats what i didn’t wanna have to compromise. Considering it does dull the display a bit. Im happy they offer a replacement but its a $10 shipping charge every time, so after 4 times you’re better off buying a new one. My sister got the belkin one and its pitch back on the side with much better display clarity. Will be getting the belkin one instead. Not sure if its super different that the non-privacy screen one, but from my experience not worth it

I bought Flolab screen protected because of your review around 4 years ago, and I watched your whole video and all testing you've completed and I've been blown away! Like WOW. And it was all true: That Flolab screen protector based off your recommendation lasted me for a long time and I never replaced that first one and it was just amazing experience. Very nice touch, I like how it interacted with water drops etc.

I continue to get Flolab screen protectors and only had that one all of these 4 years but the thing is - they started to break a lot easier than before. And yes they do cover it with a warranty which costs me like $11 to replace it, and so now I am realizing - it's very much possible that they're up to something: or maybe I am dropping my phone much more... At the same time it's nice to have an insurance for the screen protector. 

Regardless of that I still have to go with a Flolab and probably because I just haven't seen anything better.

I followed the instructions and cleaned the phone thoroughly. I’m giving it another chance because it looks and feels great, so I just ordered two more for my new iPhones 16 and 17.

Thanks for making these videos! 

I have a question; I’ve been using Flolab screen protectors for years now, they are much better than any other I’ve tried. 

However, they always start to bubble at the top of the screen after 1-2 months, why is this happening? (iPhone user)

I always install it in a dust free clean room, wash my hands before installing and follow the installation video to every step.

Flolab always replaces it, but it is quite expensive to pay for shipping almost every month.

I was hoping it wasn't going to be the Flolab.. lol.. primarily because the USPS halted their shipment to me on the 20th and just today updated that they consider it "Postal Service property under USPS regulations" due to "counterfeit postage." I originally reached out to their support when I got the first update on the 20th and they told me following day that the "USPS service provider system is experiencing a malfunction." and that "Upon checking, I see that your order is currently in transit." The image they placed in their reply was from their side and not the USPS tracking number. I've reached out to them again, but haven't heard anything back yet. Can get you screenshots if you want to use in another video, etc. I hope they make it right. I was happy with last year's screen protector on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. Sadly, my shiny new orange boi is still hanging out  in the box because the protector hasn't arrived. I'm one of those weirdos who likes to unbox and immediately apply the screen protector before I begin using my new phone.

I have not seen a very comprehensive review of screen protectors, but now. I have been spending hundreds of dollars on screen protectors, so here's to hoping that Flolab will reign supreme for at least a couple of years with my iPhone 17 Pro. I just bought the one with privacy after watching your review and took the bite of $60 CAD using your discount code. (It still works!) What sold me on Flolab is that I wear polarized prescription sunglasses. I can't wait to test my new screen protector. Thank you for this review.

    Their lifetime warranty is pretty good too. They don't cover the shipping on the new protector, but I've made claims multiple times and it's been a pretty seamless experience to get a replacement. Sometimes bubbles can be difficult to get out from under the edges (since they're reinforced) but generally speaking I've had a great experience with their products over the past 3 years.

    The Benks screen protectors are decent and you get two for half the price of the Flolab. I usually use a Flolab but with my 16 Pro Max I broke 3 of the Flolab screen protectors (I don't use a case on my phone) and usually keep the Benks protectors on hand and use them while I wait on a new Flolab one to arrive. You can get the Benks from Amazon next day. The antiglare on the Benks isn't as good as Flolab but it isn't bad. I don't . BTW, the Benks for the 16 pro max works just fine on the 17.

It really properly bothers me how companies are just fully allowed to flat out fabricate shite about their products to consumers…you’d think making misleading claims about stuff should be illegal, surely?

Anyway, great video as always! Very few people on here that cut through the noise to give viewers honest and fact-based information. A YouTube treasure!

I don’t like the fact that virtually all of the screen protectors you tested have a black border. It means that they would obstruct some of the edges unless you install them with 100% perfect alignment.

I’ve come to settle on I don’t need any of this anymore. If you pay for insurance for your phone and you put a super durable case and a screen protector…you’re paying these companies to protect your over protected phone.

I mean, I want to like your videos. But you really give no detailed information. And are always saying you test a bunch but then only show your top 3 or 5. Having a website with actual detailed results of every screen protector you have tested would be much more useful than just saying hey here is 3 buy them all through my link. You keep saying you are a reviewer not an influencer, but your "reviews" are done very influencer like where you are not actually tracking any detailed results outside of sharing your AFFILIATE  links.

    Not sure which protector you’re using but I’m using the nano armour onetime pro for iPhone 17 (and 16 Pro according to the box) and I definitely don’t have that issue so I’m wondering if it’s a different model or a manufacturing defect. This is my first flolab screen protector and I was genuinely concerned about the screen or anything being obstructed in anyway especially with the black borders but I’ve thankfully not had that issue.

Homeboi, friend, broliolo. I am not spending a bagilion bucks on Apples “breakthrough” reducing the notch by .00atomic quark% just to then cover over 5% of the screen. I understand there is a reason but I gotta respect the fact that I’m putting my wallet through a midlife crises. I’m already super peeved that I have to get the hulk hogan 9000 case for it.
