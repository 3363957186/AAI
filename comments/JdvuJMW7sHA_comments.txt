Original M1 MBP 2020 user here. I'm holding onto my M1 here as it's still up and running despite some minor hiccups after upgrading to Tahoe. I'll be getting this M5 soon though... 😊 Looking forward to the better screen and faster everything.

I feel like apple they need to stop producing better chips because there just to powerful for the heavy users theyre ain’t gonna geting any value from it like it’s too mush and they need to focus on the software and changing the design and style that’s is the big innovation because if they kept just making more and more powerful chips  no one else is gonna consider buying ithem because there is no reason to upgrade from m4 to m5 like it’s waisting of money .

The rumours were that it was going to be released in the spring. They sneaked this one in. Does anyone think it would make sense if they skipped the M5 for the pro and Max chips until the OLED redesign? Then they could launch the M6 with all three models.

Got a MBA M4 32/1TB earlier this year and I tell you, 512 GB and 16 GB is not enough, you'll have to upgrade that at least to 24/1TB, unless you're just browsing the web.

My M1 Pro has the same design and same ports. The battery is fine, around 85%. It’s still fast for my tasks. I’ll go for m9-m11. Your m5 hasnt got the pro chip and therfore I think the uppgrade isnt worth it.

I have an M1 MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and it has exactly the same ports as the M5. I guess the difference is that the M5 you are describing is the base Pro - which didn't have the new shell, etc. That is what has changed, right?

------------------------------------------------------------

[16] @davidbeckett1565  👍0  2025-10-25
Great video as usual with very good, thought-provoking, points. I am very tempted to upgrade my M3 MacBook Air for the extra ports, nano-texture screen, and speakers, but don't want to buy something I would hate when the new ones are announced in spring 2026. It's also hard to justify moving on from a brilliant laptop which still has nearly 2 years of AppleCare remaining, but the occasions when this has told me to quit programs because of system space is annoying, just as those times when a transfer takes several minutes when it would be very quick on the M5 Pro. Every time I see a reflection in the screen, I could buy a computer where that wouldn't be an issue! #firstworldproblems

------------------------------------------------------------

[17] @KukiCrusader  👍16  2025-10-25
My M1 Air is still smooth like butter 4+ years later. Can't complain at all for my use cases. It is the best laptop I have ever owned. Never heats up, never slowed down, fully silent. And the battery health is still at 85%....I don't think I'll ever buy a pro laptop, It's overkill for what I need a laptop to do.

 I expected Apple to go nuclear with gaming support back in 2020-21 with Apple silicon....but it's not really there is it? For games, you're still better off getting the latest Lenovo or Asus laptops. Much more value.....

Other than gaming, personally Macbooks are the perfect laptop. Used a Dell previously, and owned a ROG series gaming laptop 8 years ago and M1 Air is just so much more reliable. And 4+ years now, it doesn't feel like it's aged, which I can't say I felt with my previous laptops after the same amount of time.

    ↳ @astromatt75  👍1  2026-01-22
    I wish my M1 Air was smooth as butter - the animations are really choppy since upgrading to MacOS 26.2. It feels like Apple have deliberately made it slow to get me off the M1 (who knows). I was going to downgrade to the previous MacOS but have decided to pull the trigger on this M5 MacBook Pro.

    ↳ @astromatt75  👍0  2026-01-22
    For anyone interested, the animation stutter happens in MacOS 26.x if you are using Stage Manager and have 'Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices' switched on. Turn this setting off and bingo everything is smooth as butter again. I found this on stack exchange and was surprised it solved the problem.

I've got a 2019 MBP with the i7, but 32RAM, amd wooooweee shes slowing down, but I do video editing and record a podcast, and teach adobe programs and long as I don't do it all at the same time, it's mostly fine haha. I actually might need to upgrade... maybe if they bring the M5 chip to the 16" version.

    ↳ @kylefan8478  👍0  2025-10-26
    @the_bruce-z1w works just fine for the typical work you do on a laptop. email, browsing, videos, document creation/modification. I also do software development, I sit in a terminal all day which can be done on a 10 year old machine no issues. Not everyone cares about video editing and all that crap.

    ↳ @Zootalaws  👍0  2025-12-23
    @kylefan8478 will it, though? The XDR Mini-led has many advantages over OLED that it would need an actual drawback for Apple to throw those samsung panels out. Do you really want a panel with a third of the brightness potential?

    ↳ @Zootalaws  👍0  2025-12-23
    @the_bruce-z1w Me, almost entirely. i7, i5 (x4) and a solitary M1, to go along with my multiple Xeon Mac Pro machines.

It depends on what you think is serious. They are unix boxes, used almost entirely for their networking functions.

As servers, you get a huge bang for your buck.

I have a 28TB SAN - the Macs are exchangeable front ends. Having built large Windows and SUN datacentres for a living, I can get most of the same functionality for a few hundred dollars. Mac Minis and Mac Pros are ridiculously cheap.

[20] @cjeelde  👍0  2025-10-26
This is NOT the best MacBook Pro ever made!

The best MacBook Pro EVER made is Mid-2012 Non-Retina with DVD. 13" and 15".

After that model, every new MacBook Pro got worse!

The horror model was the Butterfly crap late 2016! We had to live with that for years! In late 2019 they replaced that 15" Butterfly with a 16" non-Butterfly and that was the start of making it better!

So in late 2021 we saw MacBook Pro 14" and 16" with M1 Pro/Max. Finally a model that's better and not worse!

After Late 2021 we've only seen chip upgrades. And that includes upgraded ports (HDMI with 4K and TB5). But these models are not as good as MBP Mid-2012!

Mid-2012: you could upgrade both RAM and the HDD plus replace the DVD with a 2nd internal HDD if you wanted to. Those HDDs was 2,5" SATA/600 so you could use SATA SSDs that are really fast! Also, it was so easy to replace the battery.

The worst models were def the Butterfly models since 2016!

Before 2012 we had some MacBook Pros with problems and that was about the graphics card I think. The first MBP from Early 2006 with Core 1 Duo got really hot and that got kind of solved with Late 2006 (Core 2 Duo).

Would love to see a Tier Maker for all MacBook Pros and also for PowerBooks!

I wanna rank MBP M5 series pretty high. Not S tier. Because there we have Mid-2012 Non-Retina. So a weak A or strong B.

------------------------------------------------------------

[24] @SharonAnn1999  👍4  2025-10-25
I see that the M5 is a bit faster and more efficient on paper, but those gains mainly benefit heavy workloads like video editing, 3D graphics, or large data tasks. For everyday productivity and the tasks I use it for, there won’t be a significant difference. I got a very good deal on an M4 Pro model with a good discount and great trade-in value.

------------------------------------------------------------

[25] @watersa77  👍0  2025-10-26
Why wouldn't you just wait for the M5 Air and save $700?  It's basically the same laptop except it's thinner, lighter and doesn't have promotion.

    ↳ @MarkEllisReviews  👍1  2025-10-26
    Because none of us know when that's coming. If you want an Air, get the M4 version today - it's superb.

I love my M1 MBP, it has MagSafe and all the various ports that I need - the battery capacity is down to 80% but that doesn't bother me because I don't take it very many places. I have 32GB memory and 2TB hard drive and this Mac does everything I ask it to without any issues. It's a great machine.

I'm holding on to this M1 MBP until they get rid of the notch (I'm a menu bar items junkie and the notch gets in the way which means I have to ration my use of menu bar items) and/or some sort of compelling chassis redesign.

I've got an M1 MacBook pro. (It's specked up from base model bo maybe my experience is different from the base model M1 pro users .) I'm a designer using the Adobe suite.and after effects for motion graphics.

It's still fast. I don't really run I to issues when working. There is no need to upgrade. As I would never be doing work in after effects without a large secondary monitor. So battery isn't an issue there. And I get a good half day out of the battery still when working out and about.

apart from an annoying secondary display bug where I get vertical lines and flickering with some web browser (Google login) and (wallet) popups mainly. Not sure why this has never been fixed.

The M1 was the major leap. I see nothing new here apart from speed. Which unless I'm getting more into blender I doubt I will need. I don't want the invasive ai. I have siri turned off.

[31] @Dynamics416  👍0  2025-10-25

[38] @JesusArmasOficial  👍0  2025-10-27
When this was released a few weeks ago I was kinda surprised and somewhat disappointed. I did not expect Apple to release something like this but given the specs, I think it’s a very good option for those who want a Pro laptop from Apple without the extra optional power from the Pro and Max chips. 
I’m currently using an M1 Max MacBook Pro for music production and some light video production in Resolve and if I upgrade, I will definitely move towards another Max chip and certainly doubling the RAM (currently 32GB) 

Hopefully an M5 Max will be released next year.

Mine is the 2022, M2 MBA, 8/10, 16gb, 512gb. I configured it spec’d up so that i could use it for 5 years, and it still does the office work that i purchased it for. It is far and away better than the Intel Macs that i had in the past. However, i think when and if the M6 MBP comes out with an OLED display and new design as has been leaked, then it may be time to upgrade. My workflow is primarily office work, M365, Outlook, Zoom, Teams, Web Browsing, etc.

Going from a 2019 Intel MacBook Pro, with nothing but four Thunderbolt 3 ports, to an M2 MacBook Pro with MagSafe, HDMI—and *finally* tossing the Touch Bar—makes upgrading to any more recent M-series MacBook a lot harder.

I think the M2 series sets the standard. Since then, there have been incremental upgrades in power, but the form factor is not much changed. (And that's not a bad thing.)

I have the M1 with the previous design, I won't update until the design changes. I never buy the base model, so my M1 already has 1 TB of storage and 16 GB or ram, and it works amazingly still. I also love the thinner design and the touch bar. The only thing maybe I don't like as much is the screen, but I heard that the next design will come with Oled so it is worth waiting for me.

For most of us normies, there's no reason to upgrade any M macbook... I still have an Intel MBP... its still fine. I'm not running AI workloads or editing video. Its fine. Who's doing serious gaming on the Mac anyway? I've got a PC for that as well as for my CAD package. Same with phones.. all this incremental stuff is just techno fomo. No less than 5 years on upgrades for me. Good example is the watch. There's BARELY any differences model to model.  And for typical use cases for iPad, refresh every 10 years is probably enough. I've got everything Apple except vison pro, but I'm not dumb about unnecessary upgrades. Just upgraded my wifes iphone x to a 15 because its good enough for how she uses it.

I upgraded in 2024 from a 8gb M1 Macbook Air, to a 16gb M3 Macbook Air ..... Speed wise, performance wise, couldn't honestly tell any difference. Did like the newer design though. I bought the M3 Air in the early days of release too, so I had to pay £200 for the extra unified memory. Speced it up to 16GB/512GB. Total cost, £1499. (£100 less than the current base Macbook Pro, with the same unified memory and storage).
I do think too much is made of the 8gb thing still through. Before I took my M1 Air back to Apple, I opened pretty much every app on each laptop, about 20 safari tabs on each, and was flicking between them all and using them all, with videos playing in the background. Really pushed both the 16GB M3 and 8GB M1 ..... Honestly, couldn't tell any difference.
I'm almost certain jumping from the M3 Air to the M5 Pro or Air, I will likely tell even less difference. At least when I upgraded, I got the new design.

In the M1 MacBook pro Apple made a product that was good. They didn't hold back features to make you buy the next model. They finally gave us everything we wanted. And in return got something better than another sale from the next generation of chip... They got an army of happy customers that highly recommend apple laptops to everyone. 

Definitely worth the upgrade if you are on intel Mac or any windows laptop though. (Just because of how bad windows is getting)

as a car the perfomance of a laptop is a summary of things. I think that despite the upgrades in the cpu architecture the increase of storage speed (they doubled the speed) and the ram bandwith increase has the most impact on the increased performance. I mean i think that a m4 pro base line with this ssd speed would be much closer in numbers

My M1 is now down to 85% battery life. Several improvements I see is, less spinning wheel of death when using Adobe products the HUGEST improvement is the increase in number of useable ports (less dongles/hubs) .

    Cool. 

The M5 has five years development on the M1. My M1 Mini feels at least twice as fast as my i7 Mini, but the M5 feels 4x as fast - nearly as fast as a Mac Studio.

It's also more than twice as fast in computing, 2.5x faster graphics processor,  2.2x faster RAM with a 2.5x wider bandwidth, 300% faster in SSD read/write, has a lesser screen and audio subsystem, weighs more and has  about half the battery life.

Which doesn't mean the M1 is a bad machine. it's better than nearly everything in the intel and amd space, but the M5 is a major improvement across the board.

For those of us still running i5's, it makes a very attractive option.

Intel MacBk Pro (2013) owner: 2 reasons I hadn't bothered to upgrade; 1. I had bought an M4 Mac mini and had re-fallen in love with a desktop computer. 2. My workplace insisted on supplying me with a Windows Laptop despite my pleading to use my own Mac (I teach music to kids at school and the Mac is so much more versatile - I won't even start on that one.
But now my Windows PC is playing up - same reason as my old Windows PC back in the day. Windows Updates likes to muck around with your Audio drivers.  After an OS update it used to move them around the system and I would have to go hunting/exploring to find them again.  One day I just said 'that's it' and I went and bought a Mac - never looked back.  Windows Update is doing this to my work-Laptop now and a music teacher trying to teach without any audio files is a bit of a joke.
I was thinking of getting a 15" Mac Bk Air but back when the 14" Mac Bk came out everyone was raving about how good they were for music production.  And it will have more ports on it as well so `I got to do me some thinking.
Bear in mind that I never owned an M-Series Mac of any description until last year.  
My iPad Pro is the 2018 version and it's still pretty good although I might take a look at the M5 model as well.
Obviously I can't get both so I got to get thinking about this - advice is welcomed as I have hit a junction and there are 3 ways to go:
Mac Air (probably 15") - Mack Bk Pro (M5 14") - iPad Pro (13"/M5)
Cheers.

16GB of ram still isn't enough these days. Apple is building in planned obsolescence with these macbooks and still extorting customers on crazy expensive ram upgrades. Charging 300 dollars for a measly 8gb upgrade to 24GB, and 600 dollars for 32 GB is downright criminal.
 From other reviews I've seen the new M5 14" also suffers from thermal throttling due to the anemic cooler apple uses and the fact the M5 draws more power. I'm going to guess after a while apple will release updates that will hamper performance to keep thermals in check.
 Is it a nice machine sure, but apple is still lagging in base specs for a "pro" classified machine which makes this thing feel overpriced. The delusion that 16GB of ram is somehow magically more on a Mac is ridiculous and just shows a level of brainwashing from apple.

I have an intel MBP ( 2014) which I keep on telling myself is due for an upgrade so this could be the year I finally bite the bullet and get out my credit card for Apple to plunder. The Mac Mini (Base Model) also looks very tempting to replace my PC and free up some desk space! Just take all of my money Apple as I'm sure I will also "need" a new 120 Hz Apple Display when its released in 2026. :)

Be honest it’s a boring release. I will loose respect for you if you can’t see that. Apple can release M6 now and they wants to eek things out. Let’s face it the M1 to M5 difference is either apple upgrading elements that were sub standard to begin with or bring everything into line. There aren’t any massive jumps here and how long had it been between the M1 and M5? 5 years and this is the difference- is that innovative enough?

For standard M chips, I think the Air is where it’s at and not the MacBook Pro. 

For MacBook Pros, the base M4 Pro is cheaper than a 24 GB M5… so the decision isn’t so simple if you need better graphics.

Sorry to interrupt the MBP M4 Base Chip was 16/512 so the 512 is not a M5 Thingy, only the MBA M4 and the Mac Mini M4 Non-Pro was available with 256GB of storage which is still an affront to the people.

The real question is what is the difference to the MBA M5, does it also come with 512 GB as baseline, so there is a cardreader and there is a third TB-port and a HDMI-port as a Bonus, and a fan as a downside (i love my silent MBA)
Cardreader yes and no modern cameras either go to more modern storage than SD-cards or don't have changeable cards, and an SD-Card adapter you can get for 10 bucks at amazon, HDMI port YES BUT you go for DP via TB anyway with USB-power supply via the TB-cable if you get a newe monitor anyway, remains one big advantage a third TB-port but for that advantage nearly 50% more weight than a MBA, a small USB hub is available for around 20 bucks and a TB hub around 60 bucks.

Yes for those having an intel based system its finally time to upgrade, hoping for a big discount on M4 if M5 is available ONLY for BTS variants it never was for BTC-variants. You will get better offers on the next prime day or black friday or X-mas-Sale, than for an "outdated" m4-System now. For those with M1 now it can be become interesting if your battery is heavily degraded (but a battery swap would be the more ecomic variant), if you intend to upgrade from a M2/M3/M4 Basechip than provably you should check if the Base Chip is suiting your needs or if a Pro or Max is the better choice (what i highly doubt). My daily tasks are still fully covered by an M1 MBA 16/256.

I can’t imagine someone’s reason for holding on to an Intel MacBook other than they can’t afford to upgrade 

Other than that reason you are seriously missing out 

I’ve always purchased a Pro MacBook and this year I grabbed a 15” Air and it’s just stunning

I get new Windows laptops every other month testing new gear at work, Just got a new HP G11  but nothing and I mean nothing has made me smile every time I pick it up like a modern MacBook 

If you’ve got an Intel MacBook

Sell it, sell everything you own, your organs and even get a used M2 or M3

Bro can you help me decide i am in analysis paralysis ?

M4 Macbook Air 13   VS   M5 Macbook Pro 14

context: 
-This will be my personal laptop not work.
- I am a software developer so i will be doing some of my personal projects not significantly heavy may be in future i dont know.
- I want to keep my laptop for 8-10 years.
- I want 32gb ram but people are saying if you need 32gb ram go to Macbook PRO.
- I like fanless design of M4 air but i am anxious because what if in future it started to heat because apps will get heavier and heavier.
- if i go with air 24gb 512gb vs 32gb 512gb pro difference is 900 cad in final price. 
- air is very sleek but very small.

My issue is am i wasting money ? i do have budget but i dont want to just spend unnecessarily

PS: THis will be my very first macbook purchase ever. Always used windows till now.

I have a 2019 13" Intel i5 MBP and purchased a 14" M4 PRO MBP three weeks ago. I am happy to say that Apple will take this laptop back from me, give me a full refund and I will just purchase the 14" M5 PRO MBP when it gets released, hopefully in the Spring of 2026. The reason for me doing this is because I intend to keep this M5 PRO MBP for at least 10 years and I would rather have a brand new 2026 MBP than a perfectly decent m4 PRO MBP which, although brand new, has technology that's at least a year old. I'm a great fan of keeping old MBPs from the landfill, I have a 2012 15" MBP which I have managed to install Sequoia with the help of Open Core Legacy patcher and it still works a dream, despite the fans working overdrive.

Hahaha 😂 Yes, M5 is better.... M6 and M7 will be better still. ...And yes, there will be a new design, OLED display, maybe touchscreen... But let's face it, technology hit a wall years ago. Around M1 actually, as the user experience, even with faster chips, isn't that much improved. I still don't need a faster chip than my M1 MBP. It still works great! Still great battery life... 

At this point, there are only minor improvements that CAN be done. Yes, it was a huge leap from when I had an Intel Windows laptop to the M1. Rendering was slashed by 40 minutes, for example! But now, if a new device can render my video in 2.5 minutes instead of 5 minutes, I really don't care. Oh, and the memory bandwidth is more on my M1 MBP (200 GB/s), than the M5 (153GB/s)...

I could easily go another 5 years with my M1 MBP, until the battery gives out 🤣 I may be tempted, though, when the new design comes out, especially if it has a better display and perhaps increased efficiency and battery life... M6, M7.... But after that upgrade, I won't need a new laptop for 8-10 years! 😅 LOL.....

However an M5 equipped mac mini (or even better an M5 pro equipped mac mini) will probably entice me to replace my old dinosaur intel based windows PC (came with Windows 7, upgraded to 10 and 11).
