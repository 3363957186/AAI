I have a VERY noisy roommate, ended up buying these on Amazon on Black Friday without doing much research just out of frustration. I’ve never had over ear headphones before, and I’m now extremely glad these are the ones I went with

Have you tried the sony xb910n ? I have and the bass is just too much, im wondering whether the xm4 will be slightly toned down and more natural on the bass compared to the 910n

    @paxry i use them on my iphone and laptop, love the dual pairing function, battery life is great. ANC is top tier and sound quality is amazing. Would recommend these or the XM3 if u dont need dual pairing

    ↳ @fclp67  👍0  2021-04-02
    @paxry if we're talking bluetooth and for this price yes, the pandas from massdrop sound better BUT they're also more expensive and don't have ANC (they are built to seal well enough without it though), otherwise Airpods Max have the single best ANC where you literally don't hear a car engine next to you, but they sound bland like boiled potatoes. If we're talking just any over-ear headphones, then obviously no. Not even for their price.

    @omarreyes2706 I don't think so, the fact that the Sony headphones have LDAC codec is going to make the sound quality better than the Airpods max, besides the noice cancelling for what I've heard is much better on the Sony Wh-xm4

    It’s on sale for $72 at Best Buy right now if you’re in the US. It’s $278 now

    ↳ @stephenvalente3296  👍2  2020-12-13
    Shame that translates to £100 more in the UK than the US from Amazon, but still way cheaper than Apples headphones with that tacky case.

    @stephenvalente3296 who gives a fuck about the case.
SOUND QUALITY is all that matters. oh battery life also.
knowing how good all apple products are i rekon these airpod max's will sound incredible.
just spent a lot of money lately. 2 brand new gold iphone 12 pro maxes for my wife and son and paid 1k for a ps5 for him.
soon as the bank account has recovered will be buying some of these apple headhpones.

    ↳ @justinnguyen523  👍1  2020-12-24
    @omarreyes2706 Sony and Bose are top tier headphones. I doubt the AirPods Max will overtake them and they are overpriced as well.

    ↳ @omarreyes2706  👍1  2020-12-25
    @justinnguyen523 Well i have been seeing the AirPods are much better but like you said the Sony are cheaper and still good quality.

    ↳ @Maple_Tachibana  👍0  2020-12-26
    @Xinge Gao I didn't get what you were trying to say. Rephrase perchance?

    ↳ @Maple_Tachibana  👍0  2020-12-27
    @Xinge Gao I see, well I still hold my opinion though. Take it as it is, Apple needs to lower their price a tad bit if they want us consumers to opt for their headphones. 

The Sony becomes a more viable option when they (Apple Headphones) came out lol.

    ↳ @immortalized_onion  👍0  2021-06-27
    @λύκος-ξ5β  that makes no sense.

    ↳ @PurushNahiMahaPurush  👍0  2021-07-04
    For the price of the max you can buy 1 XM4 and 1 XM3. And you also get actual cases for your headphones lol. Apple's headphones maybe slightly better but it's not worth the price like every other Apple product

    ↳ @PurushNahiMahaPurush  👍0  2021-07-04
    @ianwiskle812 idk about ldac making sound quality better. There is more to sound quality than just bit rates. From what I've seen in reviews, Apple has a better frequency response. More neutral and a wider sound stage. Sony's default frequency response is very very bass heavy to the point it actually sounds muddy. Apple also has slightly better NC, better transperency mode and waaaayyyy better call quality. Not to mention that Apple's encoding for AAC is better than Android or Windows. Apple can do wonders with 320kbps AAC audio just because of how excellent and optimized their encoding/decoding is. 

But again, the price of the headphones, their shoddy support for non-Apple devices and the fact that they don't come with any decent carrying case is why they are a bad value.

    ↳ @QuantaSolace  👍1  2021-07-28
    @omarreyes2706 Depending on who you ask, some will say they’re better. I know some audiophiles who prefer the Max over the Sony. I have both and I like my Max more. The Sony are still good though and I recommend them if you don’t want to pay more for the Max unless Amazon has a super discount on them. I bought mine when they were $50 USD off.

    ↳ @omarreyes2706  👍0  2021-07-29
    @QuantaSolace ok thanks for the help !

    ↳ @fenris.507  👍0  2021-08-14
    @isaachunt5799 I know this comment is pretty late, but yeah apple products are terrible. Especially if you're just looking at their products from a "bang for your buck" perspective. But in reality, their products just aren't good at all. You can find way better phones, laptop's, earbuds, headphones etc. Apple software is designed for baby's, and their products just really aren't as good as other brands.

    ↳ @Chevsilverado  👍0  2021-09-05
    @omarreyes2706 The AirPods max have good noise cancelling but the sound really doesn’t live up to the price tag. The case, padding and ergonomics are also pretty crappy.  The only reason I would get them is if I had a ton of money to dispose on a fashion piece, but not if I want to get the best tech and quality.  For almost $800 you can get WAYY better headphones so the only thing they have going for them is the Apple design. If they were priced and $400 or even $500 it would be a different story but they’re way to crappy to be $800.

    ↳ @Chevsilverado  👍0  2021-09-05
    @Wish You The Best Noise cancelling doesn’t let noise into the headphones so when you put them on 99% of the external noise is gone. They play opposite phased(?) frequencies to the outside noise which cancels the sound wave out. Putting on a good pair of ANC headphones is a pretty cool experience for the first time.

    ↳ @Zaihanisme  👍0  2021-09-28

    ↳ @Aidyn-Crawford  👍0  2022-06-14
    @omarreyes2706 from what i've seen, airpods max is slightly better but it's still not worth the price. additionally, you lose a lot of its perks if you aren't invested in an apple system. you lose some perks when using the headphones on non-apple technology. it also seems to sometimes emphasize higher frequences when playing music making is whiny for some people. all in all, some might say its better than sony xm4 but still not worth it's price

A two-year-old review (I'm in 2022!) and you've sold me. So I've gone from thinking of buying some so-so Sennheiser headphones at half the price to the Sony XM4. Added pain to my credit card, but worth it I think.

    @UlisesSchmidt different vacuum cleaners sound different. and different headphone earpads block sound differently. it may be perfectly usable without noise cancellation. and may be not.

    ↳ @cedricol  👍0  2020-08-14
    Well, it would have been BETTER with a comparison (could screw with the good rhythm of the video though).

    ↳ @cedricol  👍3  2020-08-14
    Is it just me or is the mic pretty bad? I wonder if it would have been better in a quieter environment.

    ↳ @rawdez_  👍0  2020-08-14
    @cedricol yeah, it seems like bose QuietComfort 35 II mic sounds better.
to me no comparison to other headphones is also a bad thing. minimal effort and fanboyism from mkbhd.

Dear @Marques,

I am a religious follower of your reviews and have been taking your word as the ultimate verdict for all my gadget purchases. However with this purchase of the MX4 I find these far lower in terms of noise cancellation in comparison with the AirPods Pro. I am also looking at all these comments of people finding this device great and I am left to wonder if there is any customization/ setting I have actively missed in setting up the noise cancellation. Please help! 

Love and Regards,
Cibi

I've just bought these and I'm really disappointed, I had very high expectations from all the amazing reviews and when I tried out the notice canceling I can still hear everything, it only very slightly cancels out background noise where as my expectations was I thought it was gonna be as quiet as me standing on the moon 🌒 so that's a disappointment, then on the other end I thought ambient sound will make me feel like spider man and hear everything but  thats not great either, then I don't think these are loud enough I'm at full volume and want it to go up another 4 levels at least.. may have to find an app that will allow me to push the volume even louder.

    ↳ @Mr-.-DB.I  👍1  2022-01-16
    Use the app to change the noise cancelling function. Change the volume settings on your phone which will give you a warning message about the 'possible damage to hearing at high volume'. On my Samsung s20fe I cant put the volume on max as its way too loud.

    ↳ @teched7759  👍0  2022-01-16
    @Mr-.-DB.I cheers man I went in the sound settings on my Galaxy Fold 3 and turned the volume up in there I did get the warning about ear damage, but sounds so much better appreciate the tip, I did do the notice cancelling within the Sony app but still don't seem that impressive where as my airpods pro you can really notice it when you turn it on, on those. 🤷

    ↳ @volundrfrey896  👍5  2020-09-09
    Sony makes a lot of products, not giving these ones a name and just calling them "the Sony" would be quite weird.  
With that said they should come up with better names for the headphones/earphones.

    ↳ @Nxrth2001  👍1  2020-09-11
    They have Cameras with similar names too. The RX100 WiFi Mark 4 is an example

    @chintan21084 I feel like Sony may either jack up the price for their XM4 or may release the XM5 for about US$400, just above the XM4s, with almost no hardware upgrade just so they could make more money per sale and still be able to appeal to more people.

I HATE most of these features 

I got most of those features on Jabra Elite 5 ANC TWS, and I couldn’t wait to turn those features off, 

The Absolute worst part about those TWS, was yes, they had all these functions you could set in the App, but you couldn’t edit or change the , thus there was no volume control on them. Play, pause, Skip, ask Siri to suck you off for a tenner, all those functions, and no volume control 😆 that’s how you don’t do “features”. So long as I can turn them off, or edit them, it’s fine.

If you want to fix the white noise from the active noise cancelling in these, you just need some foam ear plugs to wear under the headphones. 
Complete silence for an afternoon sleep while the flatmates are making noise or watching tv in the lounge. 
A travel neck pillow works wel too so you can sleep on your side while wearing them.

Good review and love the content, but I noticed couple of slight errors. The earlier generations did support multiple devices (ish), but only one for calling and one for media. So I use the M2's with media connected to my laptop and calling connected to my phone - when I get a call it pauses media on my pc and is seamless. Second, the 'quick alert' feature where external sound is played when you cover the right ear is also not new to the M4's, as I again use this on the M2's.

    ↳ @m1l3s27  👍2  2020-08-13
    See this is something I was curious about cause I had really old devices that support the function you're talking about. That's good enough for me to get the m3 than. Thanks dude.

Sound quality is not what I would call "clean and bright". They are muddy from drowning in too much bass. Dropping the bass on the eq just results in slightly better sound imo but I don't think it justifies the $350-$400 CAD price tag. All the other aspects of this product are good.

Theyre absolute crap. You cant switch off the notifications which will blow your ear off everytime the battery runs low. You slightly touch the earbuds and it will switch to voice to speak.

I was in a debacal between these and Bose Quiet Comfort 45, ive always been loyal to bose for several years now. however given that the sony headphones are £60 cheaper and I actualy got a chance to try them in store im really happy with my choice.

    @lynxaway if im honest bose are more comftable. but the sony are pretty good too I can wear them for several hours without too much bother. but definitly more notcible than bose. like I often forget my bose ones are on my head. sony ones not so much.

Had the wh-1000xm3 for the last 3 years and they finally gave out, the most comfortable headset ever and I've tried a lot. I'll admit I did put them through some sweaty workouts and some wet-hair-after-shower deals which I guarantee did the damage, they still work, just when they are turned on the right ear cup gives an uncomfortable sensation followed by steady interference noise and pain that is simply unbearable for comfortable use case. I'll have to give the wh-1000xm4 a try.

    ↳ @FanaticMind_  👍0  2021-11-04
    @Dishant161 Honestly true. But I mean EARBUDS? That's pretty impressive. The only thing is the mic is kinda crap for the price.

    ↳ @Dishant161  👍0  2021-11-04
    @FanaticMind_ Definitely agreed, that's amazing. Have tried them for a week, and they sound fantastic (although only with my OnePlus phone, didn't sound as well with my iPhone) and have top-notch ANC. My only issue is they're not very comfortable in my ears.

Maybe it's just me, but the pressure accumulates very quickly and I can't keep them in for more than half an hour. And yeah, the mic and transparency mode kinda suck compared to the AirPods Pro, but they're good enough for normal use. I returned the XM4s though, still daily driving my Pros.

    ↳ @FanaticMind_  👍0  2021-11-06
    @Dishant161 I was gonna grab a pair with the discounts but the mic quality just isn’t good enough for the price for me. Battery life, sound quality and anc all seem to be great though.

------------------------------------------------------------

[205] @golfbbqandwatches  👍2  2025-01-06
I can’t understand why these are continually rated the best ANC headphones. They sound like shit out of the box. Loose, woolly and boxy bottom end, and way too much of it. The EQ presets in the app are all rubbish so it takes some effort to make them sound just ok. The noise cancelling is good but overall the Bose QC and Sennheiser Momentum 4 leave this Sony crap in the dust. Glad I didn’t shell out hard earned money for them, they suck.

    ↳ @schizofennec  👍6  2025-01-20
    "out of the box" you answered your own question. it takes 5 mins to set an EQ then you leave it for the next 3-6 years. quit whining.

    ↳ @golfbbqandwatches  👍1  2025-01-20
    for a premium product you shouldn’t need to set an eq out of the box. I have wired Bose QC25s. No app, no eq control, nothing. They sound a million times better than the Sonys. The eq parameters in the Sony app are useless anyway. A whole 5 bands. What the hell does anyone want to do with a 400Hz filter..??

    ↳ @peaceable55  👍0  2025-01-30
    The momentum 4s are amazing sounding but have so many issues with the software that it makes them worthless. The anc also sucks on them

So I got them like a year ago and they are very good headphones... But the mic just won't do it for me. It picks up pretty much each and every background noise and it's like it amplifies it. So there is absolutely no noise cancelation on the mic and that seems to be the case for other users as well. Am I/ are we doing anything wrong? Is there an option hidden somewhere? Does it only work with certain programs/apps?

    @messy_boy0656 the fact that a high end product cannot communicate with another high end product though its the same company is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.. I play with my sony through my TV.. Which is LG.. And it can connect, tell me it ain't stupid, connect a chienese BT dongle to your ps5 and your good?! Lol, and to play with my Xbox I connect a third party cable with a mic, they couldn't even supply this as a secondary cable for such expensive headphones, to cover their own idiocracy, and still without even relating to gaming, these are shit headphones.. I can hear everything.. Conversations, cars passing by and what not.. Not to speak of in public transportation muting which is just non existent. Shittiest noise canceling ever, whoever tells you otherwise is strictly lying people. Their features literally do not work, was sitting in a bus not doing anything special and the algorithm constantly changed my mode between walking to sitting..

    @whittle (US in particular) right out of the gate when the country was attempting to enforce a lockdown, if the government would have pulled funds from the taxes the people pay and given it back to its citizens in a recursive manner in order to allow people to still have an income while quarantining, we could have had a lot more success with almost everything that's fucked rn.  You can't take away people's income and expect everyone to be cool with it and just wait out a virus.  Most of the country is not that financially stable.  By returning tax money back to the people (aka allocating tax funds where needed most) it'd enable people to have the option of quarantining for a limited amount of time. It'd allow people to continue spending money so that money can trickle upward and throughout the economy so the economy doesn't flatline. It'd signal to the people that the government is doing what it's meant for and what we pay them(/it) to do in putting it's citizens first which in turn doesn't exacerbate the massive mistrust in our government and institutions, etc, etc.

I just finally upgraded from the XM1 to these XM4....In my brief time, here are the main differences.

1 - The case for the XM1 is nicer. Strap on the case is nicer, it feels more study, the faux leather is nicer than the linen on the XM4.
2 - The XM1 is better built, more metal parts. The faux leather texture on the outside of the ear cup is nicer than rubberised texture on the XM4.
3 - The XM1's strap has 10 clicks, the XM4 has 9.  XM1 can fits larger heads.
4 - XM1's headband's angle is wider, it is a more comfortable pair to wear.
5 - XM1 sounds more open, better clarity.
6 - ANC on XM4 is better.

USB-C on the XM4 is basically why I upgraded, but besides the ANC and some tech features.  XM1 is better in almost every other way.  Better materials, better sounding, better built, better case.

[235] @bakriii1  👍0  2022-02-21
This review had undermined the mic feature

The headset it great
But the sound quality coming to the other end is really bad and robotic to some extend

Before the work from home era where the use of these headsets is mostly for listening to music, the Sony always come on top as the King of noise canceling and sound quality 
But if you are using it seldomely to communicate with others over MS team or Zoom or even phone calls, you'll find your self often in a situation where you have to repeat what u say or say it louder so the other side of the line can hear

It would be nice if you made a follow up to this review, I'd like to know if you experienced in either ear cup the sound of scratching or brushing up against something, apparently it's caused by moisture building up in the headphones after wearing them for a long time, this problem was on the XM3s also but I never had those, I had the XM2s, and while I love the new features on the XM4s, the brushing sound is kinda driving me insane...

But I really want an upgrade soon! An immersive one at that haha. And was thinking of getting these Sony ones in the video. 

I don’t actually care too much about the noise canceling aspect. I really just want a super crisp and high quality sound. The sound is the main thing I’m looking for. Have these headphones really delivered in that area for you?

I found these subpar, and returned them after 18 hours.  Major problems: the noise cancellation pauses at random.  Not as the results of speaking or any other sound that may trigger the SPEAK-TO-CHAT, but the problem seems to be correlated with picking up the device that's playing the tracks, and or using the Next Track function on the playing device.  I didn't have time to test it - that was Sony's job.  The "buttons".  The buttons to activate functions like Next/Previous Track, Volume Up/Down, etc, are simply touch pads on the right earpiece.   The problem is there's no map on the earpiece indicating where the "touch" zone might be for any particular function, so one ends up hunting around with one's finger.  This results in erroneous commands such as Next Track, when one actually meant Volume Up, or Pause, for example.  Simply embossing something small onto the zones where the controls are (little dots, for example) would give one's fingers something to map the individual functions by.

------------------------------------------------------------

[286] @saratchandradeevi  👍0  2021-07-27

    ↳ @casiquekibra  👍0  2022-04-23
    @vinylbuff1515 I'd say it's good. It's not amazing but the isolations gives it some points back over the lack of spacial sound. Like you don't feel the sound is wide you feel it constrained clearly coming from inside the headphones but I guess that's closed back for you. The moment you turn them on you're immersed and out of the world. You play music and it feels you're alone with your songs. On the app you get to tweak EQ but I never dwell in those habits of changing EQ based on music style but it's something worth noting you can do it if you want

Hi I've watched a lot of your headphone reviews, I've noticed you never talk about, headphone noise leakage. I bought my headphones after a long research of things I need from a headphone and Sony xm4 won. But I found the noise leakage is terrible, to a point my partner is annoyed when I have them on in bed. Recently I went on a trip to Mexico, and to my dismay, the passenger next to me, asked if I could turn my headphones down, I was so surprised by how much it disturbed them, as my phone was at half volume. Have you noticed this with the Sony's??And what from your experience are the best non-noise leakage headphones.
Thank you

Does anyone have experience using this headphones in a "hybrid" mode, or if it possible at all? I mean plugging the audio cable to the PC for listening audio only, while still maintaining the BT connection with a phone, so when there is a call on the phone, the headphones can switch to that input source? In my workplace it's fine to use the headphones in wired mode with the PC, but I wouldn't want to fidget around when there is an incoming call. Thanks for answering!

The USB cable provided Is really short and uncomfortable to charge it  

It's safe to charge the headphones with a iPhone charger and iPhone cable 5v or what charger should be properly to charge it?

I tried to charge it with a fast charger 18v from apple, and the headphones get a little warm, i unplugged right away.

    ↳ @mikelisteral7863  👍1  2021-04-20
    never change the volts. the volts have to be the same as what it needs. you can go higher amps though wtih no problem. a usb 3 port is 5 volts

    ↳ @walterezequiel6394  👍0  2021-04-20
    @mikelisteral7863 Thanks for the reply, I actually use my MacBook Pro charger or air to charge the headphones and didn’t get any issues. It seems that the charger or the cable provides the volts that the headphones need, at least they didn’t get warm anymore. Greetings from Argentina.

Although the multi-device connection is cool, I don't really use it due to the codec going from LDAC to AAC. I like to prioritise on good quality music, so I have the feature turned off. Maybe when Bluetooth gets better to the point that it can do multi-device through LDAC, then I would use the feature.

    And that’s why these headphones also can pause the audio when you take them off. I like that we have choices with Sony’s: speak to chat, pause while taking them off and the hand to earcup gesture (and I believe there is also a finger gesture).

    ↳ @1S1KNLJS  👍5  2020-08-26
    Some people actually use these for sensitivity issues (they wear headphones often) and let pass through for short conversations outside. I never though of it until I saw people who look for these things like the Sennheiser pxc 550. Ofcourse a minority but still people. A gimmick for some, and major comfort for others.

    You do not everyone and you arent being strapped to the headphones you can still take them off when there is music playing moreover how is it respectful to take off your headphones if you start talking to someone while the headphones are on thats still respectful not talking at all is disrespectful. Honestly you should keep your shitty opinion to your self especially in tech

    ↳ @lepotato135  👍3  2020-10-11
    @kzwei2 It's just an unspoken rule in society to take off your headphones when engaging in a verbal communication with someone else in person. It's been like this for ages and parents are the ones who have taught their kids this so I don't think it's an unpopular opinion. I don't think it's ridiculous either. Taking off your headphones when talking or listening to someone shows that you're really willing to listen to them and I think it strengthens relationships. It shows that you're willing to interrupt whatever you're listening to just to give that person some attention.

    @T. Winter Not everyone has to follow it. I just called it an "unspoken rule" to tell Kabby that the idea of removing your ear pieces in the presence of someone who's trying to talk to you isn't so ridiculous.

And I'm not sure I said it was supposed to work for hearing the person. Just that it gives the person a sign that you're willing to listen to them, whether you can pay enough attention to what they're saying or not. 

I have ADHD and half the time I don't know what someone else is talking about in public areas, but I still make sure that they know I'm trying to listen. 

I'm not enforcing the idea of having to remove your earpieces though, that's entirely up to the person and I don't mind. I was just trying to say that it's not silly to take off your earphones or headphones when you're around someone to be polite. Similarly you don't have to take them off if you don't want to either.

    ↳ @brendonpoling195  👍1  2020-11-24

Every review: “the mic improved” 
Mkbhd: record it as an example for us to listen.
Those little extra in the production makes this guy the best tech reviewer for me

    ↳ @Sportsman134  👍38  2020-08-23
    that example sounded like shit

    ↳ @Sportsman134  👍5  2020-08-24
    @Sean Clelland I know, I'm just saying that example sounded bad..which is the truth. And since MKBHD in his review didn't explicitly say he think's it was good or bad, you should listen and make that call yourself. And not just accept it, and move along with the review since its inciting and well shot.

    ↳ @axh2  👍6  2020-08-26
    @Sean Clelland But they can sound much better. Check Jabra 85h or Bose NC700. Really hoped that mic quality in MX4 will at least get close to them.

    ↳ @axh2  👍3  2020-08-27
    @Sean Clelland I totally agree with you! I was answering to "thats how these types of microphones work", I'm disappointed that such good piece of hardware (which I would really like to use) is still so bad in one aspect. I wanted to point out that it is not because of a limitation of the microphone type, and there is a huge room for improvement. I'm sure that Sony has a R&D power that would allow them to be on par with Jabra in mic quality, if they would pay more attention to it

    ↳ @CIRCADES  👍4  2020-08-30
    The mics still sound worse than the Nokia 3310! Wtf is Sony doing?

    ↳ @Nightmacer  👍8  2020-08-30
    @Sportsman134 the reason it sounds like shit is because of the background noise cancellation. If you turn it off the microphone sounds better but the people on the other side of the phone call or chat can hear the noises

    ↳ @microlobbies2378  👍0  2020-09-03
    @Sportsman134 that was with a lot of background noise it sounds better without the vacuum and all the other stuff

    ↳ @skiran69  👍5  2020-09-04
    @CIRCADES the mics sound like that because of background noise cancellation.

------------------------------------------------------------

[356] @concertsbyalex  👍1  2021-05-01
They feel very cheap - the headband is creaking when walking (same as XM3). 
Also, there are confirmed issues with condensation inside the cup that creates wind noise when using ANC. 
Most new features are a gimmick and cannot recommend the XM4 with their current issues. Too bad the review doesn't touch on these.

------------------------------------------------------------

[357] @RawHalibut1278  👍1  2021-04-25
Sony or Bose?
Who is the headphone King?

    ↳ @HeadsetAdvisor  👍1  2021-05-18
    That is tough! They are both fantastic. I think it really depends on the use case. If it's just for mobile phone/tablet use then the Sony is great. If you also want to use the headset for computer based applications like softphones, video meetings etc then the Bose 700 UC is a great option. We have did in depth reviews with mic tests on both.

Guys I tested these out myself in PC World (without the app) against the Bose Y600nc and ngl, these have a really nice seal with the earcups which gives you noise cancelling without even using anc. It sounds so premium as if you are in an airport with big loud speakers playing. Clarity and stuff on these is just something else. Defo for those that dont wanna give a f*ck of what is going on in the world lol. Imagine how good these would be with the app. Mind blowing!

So i have the Sony WH-1000XM4 in usage for 6 months now...
It is damn amazing but, sometimes it switches to being "talk-sensitive" while i didn't changed settings at ALL!!!!!

What's up with this? Anyone else experiencing this??

------------------------------------------------------------

[410] @BonanzaPilot  👍0  2021-08-17
Is it worth upgrading to these from QC15's? Like is the noise cancelling that much better. I mostly just use them while in a commercial airliner for noise cancellation and have been using a little Bluetooth dongle for about 10 years now. I'm happy with them but have some very long trips coming up and considering an upgrade.

[411] @mehVhem  👍8  2021-06-01
Absolutely love the design, sound quality is dope, ANC is fantastic, but omg I find the touch controls so incredibly annoying and clunky to use. Especially when they're around your neck and on, they get triggered so easily

2 connections only works with the worst quality codec. Plastic hinges still cracking and breaking (see Amazon reviews). Moisture from the ears still causing crackling noises for many many people. Search YouTube. Call quality still sucks completely. Your call partners complain they can't hear you clearly.

your take on the design being flawed, that it would be better if it got a dial or two would destroy the stylish appearance that they've got

I regret buying these headphones. They tend to turn off in the middle of me watching a video or listening to music, they automatically switch to another device in the middle of me listening to music or watching a video, the sound keeps cutting off every few minutes. They're so damn annoying.

Marquess, the feature of putting your hand over the right earcup (resulting in lowering the music level, stopping the noise cancellation and switching on the pass-though)... that was already available in the XM3s. And it is working just as you described it here. I'm just mentioning it, as in the video it sounded like this is a new feature ("... you can also now, while the music is playing, put your hand..."), which is not. And someone could wrongly take this as a differentiating factor over the XM3s. Except that - great review, as always! Best regards!

    ↳ @sam5992  👍1  2020-08-13
    Yeah, and it's not the greatest feature in the world. Honestly, it's much easier to take the headphones off for a minute to talk to someone rather than have your hand on the side of your face the whole time. Pretty much everyone won't understand what the feature is, so they'll think you're an idiot. 

Also, it triggers when you have your head resting on your hand, arm,  or shoulder, so it can be annoying.

There's a difference between product review and your own reviews. Please don't mix them. It's kinda 8 minutes speech we are listening and waiting when the product review will come, but there's isn't any.

Hey everyone, I am looking for an allrounder, which means an over-ear headset for listening music (especially when travelling) and for gaming (especially singleplayer on PS5). I have looked up the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless, the BOSE QC45, the Sony WH-1000XM5 and also the Sony WH-1000XM4. It seems like I really like the older one from Sony (XM4) but I am not sure if this is still a good choice 3 years after release? If not, can you recommend something else?

    @k12.06 Unfortunately not, but I am leaning towards the XM4. The XM5 would be nice too but there are 2 disadvantages: 1. I guess the thinner headband will hurt after some time 2. the price of the XM5 is 299 USD where I live and the XM4 are at 219 USD.

    Yes they are if you actually look around. You can buy these in refurbished condition (essentially "like new" condition) from a big/reputed seller for $179 or $199 when those deals come around. It's astonishing to me that people actually spend $350-$500 to buy these absolutely brand new at physical/online stores.

    @liam1902 I don’t trust “refurbished” things all that well, way too many times I’ve seen “refurbished” products not at all as described and then you don’t even have headphones at all. My point is these should not at all be this expensive still years later. 3 years after initial release they should be heavily discounted.

    ↳ @liam1902  👍1  2023-03-19
    @ZettiHDz Understandable. I think due to the major design change, they can keep both XM4 and XM5 at higher prices. I think the Bose QC35 series and NC700 are also the same way.

I have these. Comfortable. Background sound cancel really works. Bluetooth and range distance is good. Pause and volume adjust through the phones themselves is good. Sleek looking and elegant / sensual to touch. Lot to love and respect. (!!!) BUT (!!!) mediocre BATTERY life / charge / total experience. Very frustrating and exhausting, feels like I'm constantly battling to keep these charged. Have to recharge 3-4 times a day. Suri type voice lady comes on 'sorry battery too low bye bye' right in the middle of movies / homework / etc. Have a class by zoom or to write a paper on a movie for school due in two hours and NOPE these will NOT be a sure thing because of the battery dynamics. Also Unclear HOW MUCH is in them at any moment. Drains through battery life like a hummer does gas. But maybe I'm a liar and a hater and yet Google the recent article by Gizmochina...title is "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones spotted on FCC, may sport new design, larger battery, & fast charging". Exactly.

    It's probably because he's more of a tech reviewer than an audiophile. The XM3s are very popular consumer headphones but let's face it, they sound rubbish. Bloated boomy bass, to much lower mid range, lack of detail in the top end and general lack of control and poor articulation.

    Sadat Hasan That level of criticism is nothing wrong when we’re talking about $300+ headphones. If you wanna feel good about your purchase because for some reason you’re still insecure then don’t read reviews or don’t listen to audiophiles, simple

    ↳ @richardw1992  👍5  2020-08-13
    @EpicFailcze I'm glad you asked, I spent several weeks auditioning about 15+ different headsets before deciding which to get. 

The best sounding Bluetooth ANC headphones I've tried are without a doubt the Master & Dynamic MW65, their frequency response is phenomenal (only when they're in wireless mode), but their ANC isn't very good and the passive seal of the ear cups isn't very good. So they're actually not much good for the situations you would probably want them, i.e. commuting or on the go. On sound quality alone though these really moved me.

The second best sounding I've auditioned is the Jabra Elite 85H. These are also fantastic all rounders, comfy, great ANC and microphone quality, and great value. IMO the sound quality of the Jabras puts the competition from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, B&W, B&O (you name it...) to shame.

A lot of consumer headphones tend to have an over emphasised bass response (the Sony XM3s are a prime example of this). On first listen this sounds appealing and the average consumer will normally be quite satisfied. It you take the time to compare different headphoned side by side you will notice there is a lot more to a good balanced sound than just having strong bass. To much bass will mask and cover up detail in mid range instruments such as piano, guitar, vocals etc. A lack of treble or a quiet treble in comparison to the bass level will make them sound less detailed and have less clarity. It's important for the midrange to be smooth and consistent too without any dips or peaks so that instruments appear at the right levels and position in the mix. 

The Jabras Impressed me because the bass was strong and tight without any unnecessary boom and bloat. They had a prominent and smooth midrange, whereas a lot of consumer headphones are V-shaped or scooped out, and the treble was also nice and detailed without sounding harsh.

There used to be a great YouTube reviewer called Jim's Review Rooms where he did sound comparisons. Whilst this in noway compared to listening to them in the flesh it's a great way to start to understand how much the sound can change from one headset to another.

The most disappointing headsets I listened to in the wireless ANC bracket were the Sony XM3s, the B&W PX7s and the Sennheiser Momentum wireless 3s. 

Top 3 in order would be the M&D MW65, Jabra Elite 85h and 3rd place would probably be the Bose 700. Having grown to dislike most of Bose' offerings the 700s are actually a remarkably balanced set of headphones, they smooth out some of the midrange problems that the QC35 have and generally sound good.

Now part of my views will all be down to taste. I mainly listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music such as tech and house, so this is partly why the bass heavy headphones sound so bad to me, because it's just overpowering. However, when I listen to rock/metal which has much less bass in the mixing/mastering of the music the headphones which sounded so horrible to me with house music do start to give the music a bit more life and ooomph in the lower frequencies. In fact metal thrived of thick low mids and the Sony's compliment that quite well, to some extent. This doesn't make up for their general lack of detail and muddiness however.

My advice, buy the Jabras, you won't regret it.

    ↳ @qps9380  👍1  2020-08-13
    @EpicFailcze in that category, sound quality doesn't get much better that the XM4s im pretty sure

    ↳ @qps9380  👍1  2020-08-13
    @richardw1992 did you, by any chance, try and change the EQ of the headphones you were testing and redo the tests? There's no reason to test with a sound signature that you dislike, because then you are just recommending headphones with a sound signature that you like.

I personally love the sound on my XM3s because they have a good amount of bass, and I like that, but that's just personal preference.

    ↳ @horsthorni  👍1  2020-08-13
    @richardw1992 include some google links and you'd probably earn some money...well deserved. Thanks for the review!

    ↳ @richardw1992  👍0  2020-08-13
    @qps9380 yes I used all the companion apps and had a play with the equalisers to see how they reacted, my general focus was however on comparing them all flat without DSP to make it a fair playing field. 

Whilst in theory you could apply such drastic DSP/EQ through software to completely alter the sound of a headset, this would only be attempting to cover up for that headsets lack of ability to perform correctly out of the box. DSP is very powerful, but there is a lot of analogue engineering that goes into fine tuning sound from the materials used in the speaker diaphragm, the magnet type, the size of the ear cups and chamber, the material of the ear pads etc. Interestingly one headphone I tried had such drastic factory DSP applied which you were unable to turn off, it initially sounded fantastically flat and transparent then I quickly realised there was compression on certain transients where the software couldn't keep up with the music it and it ended up all over the place! They were called the "Cleer Flow II" a prime example of how DSP alone can't polish a turd. 

Furthermore, the companion app would only apply to my phone. So if I wanted to listen to music on a laptop for example then those EQ / DSP tweaks wouldn't be present. I've also heard on the Sony's that if you use an advanced codec like LDAC or aptX the equaliser is disabled?

    ↳ @ognintendo7061  👍1  2020-08-13
    @richardw1992 tbh on a train commute I want the #1 noise canceling in the industry. Which the Sony has. If you want to listen critically. I have HD6XX and a nice class A amp and good dac at home.

    ↳ @CentinalxGaming  👍0  2020-08-13
    @richardw1992 I miss Jim 😢 I haven't really looked around too see if there where any tech channels that specialized in headphones after he left so I've been out of the loop. You seem pretty well versed on the current scape and I'm definitely interested in the jabras you mentioned now so I thank you for that.

    ↳ @richardw1992  👍3  2020-08-13
    @ognintendo7061 agreed, Sony's were ahead on the ANC, Bose 700 not far behind. The Jabras have pretty impressive ANC too. 

Also, worth mentioning that on a noisy commute the low frequencies are the first to get lost in the mix, so having a bit of a bass boost will make the Sony's more suitable to noisier environments and sound better on the tube etc.

Critical listening, however, is not their strong point.

    ↳ @ognintendo7061  👍0  2020-08-13
    @richardw1992 exactly what I bought them for 👍. The tube

    ↳ @richardw1992  👍1  2020-08-13
    @CentinalxGaming I was sad to hear Jim was moving on to pastures new. Whilst I didn't always agree with all of his comments and choice of words about how certain headsets sounded, he did provide a fantastic service to the public and the only person I've known to actually record the audio samples for A/B comparisons like that.

I think the Jabras are probably the best sounding wireless headphones going under £400. They offer great clarity and detail. Try and have a listen to them in a shop side by side with some Bose and Sony models and I think you'll be surprised!

    ↳ @ImNewmann  👍0  2020-08-13

Also something really annoying is the distorted voice you got on Windows machines when you switch from music to Skype, teams, zoom call or vice versa  it is always 20-30 sec distorted sound. Don't know if it is a Windows thing, had it on 2 different laptops not on android. But for me price vs day2day use is kinda disappointing, my 5y old headset (Backbeat pro)  in the same price range had similar features, better battery life never distorted sound issues ,maybe a bit less sound quality.

    ↳ @HeadsetAdvisor  👍1  2021-05-18
    The Sony is a great option but not for all applications. We have heard this complaint as well for people using the headset on computer applications. There are some comparable fantastic options we have reviewed that will work great on both mobile phones and computer based applications.

    R7YH7N you’re acting like the margin on these isn’t in the dozens of percentage points

    ↳ @R7YH7N  👍3  2020-08-13
    @arucious any particular brands that we can test? I have tried the XM3s the bose and cheaper models and the difference is noticeable. As for those percentage points it may not be fair but hey what can you do free market capitalism and all that jazz.

    ↳ @arucious  👍0  2020-08-13
    R7YH7N I’m not saying it’s a problem lol. The original point was about sales. Would dropping their margin not boost their sales? The # of people buying $350 headphones vs headphone market sales is still very small. There’s lots of options if you don’t go the wireless route, ATH-M40x, Philips X2s, Hifimans, Sennheisers, etc.

    ↳ @mlv5746  👍0  2020-08-13
    @arucious since these are advertised as business/commute headphones, one of their main strenghts should be comfort i.e. bluetooth.
Plus if they sold them at a lower price, the headphones might lose their reputation as class-leading which is probably more important to sony than their headphone sales. They probably don't account for 10% of their income.

    ↳ @R7YH7N  👍0  2020-08-13
    @arucious guess thats the big decider feature set preference I am not an audiophile as much as I am a gamer so would be concerned as these headphones do not have low latency aptx support unlike the xm3s so when it comes to ps5 audio just wondering if it will be an issue. Sony tend to do dick moves when it comes to removing features across their product lines the sennheissers look great but the design of these xms are just peak.

    ↳ @arucious  👍0  2020-08-13
    R7YH7N you wouldn’t catch me with any of these near gaming vs a pair of open-back headphones with proper soundstage ala Philips X2s

    ↳ @Festival-sb2kf  👍1  2020-08-13
    @arucious nah $350 is reasonable for these. Other competitors like Bose also cost around the same.

    ↳ @Anistar95  👍0  2020-08-13
    @arucious I feel $350 is worth the price. I am an extremely heavy-handed user with a tendency to rough handle products. I have used a variety of headphones including the Ath M40X, Shure Srh440 etc in the lower price category. They never lasted more than a year(Shure not even 6 months!). I had the XM2 for 3 years which is still working albeit extreme scratches and cracking in the headbands. I felt given the life and quality of construction, it was worth the purchase.

    ↳ @arucious  👍2  2020-08-13
    Mlv 

Sony isn’t Apple. Outside of tech groups, nobody knows these exist. There’s no class-leading reputation for them to withhold. Bose is a household name for this segment over Sony any day of the week. 

People who know their headphones aren’t buying these, they’re investing in audio gear. 

I agree that for business/commuting the Bluetooth and Comfort are top priority. I was just pointing out that “best headphones for this price range” didn’t make any sense. If Bluetooth and comfort are your top priority, they’re up there, for sure, but you could make a case for AirPods or anything of the sort as well.

    ↳ @arucious  👍0  2020-08-13
    Utsav Festival I didn’t say it’s unreasonable — I said their sales would go up if the price was lower.

    ↳ @arucious  👍0  2020-08-13
    Anistar95 maybe, but my argument wasn’t about their worth, just that their sales would go up if the price were lower. Sony’s NC lineup doesn’t have Bose’s household brand image yet.

    ↳ @Anistar95  👍2  2020-08-13
    @arucious Well I traveled a lot in airplanes and I could see a number of Sony's on ppl's heads these days. I agree that naming sense could be better when I recommend these to my friends. But anyone willing to spend north of $200 for a headphone really does take time for research. And there are so many tech channels and blogs which recommend Sony's. Bose might seem like a household name because they were the first noise-canceling headphones that fascinated the window-shopper. Any serious buyer would have definitely considered Sony's at some point.

    ↳ @2drealms196  👍1  2020-08-14
    @R7YH7N Sony is no longer using Qualcomm chips whom own the various APTX codecs.  Perhaps it was a tradeoff in order to get some of the improvements? Interestingly their latest earbuds continue to use the qualcomm chips.

    ↳ @tinamoul  👍0  2020-08-14
    @arucious They are noise cancelling headphones, not reference headphones. They're sound isn't supposed to be the primary selling point, the noise cancelling is. And yet they sound great. And they're arguably the best bang for your buck in their class.

    ↳ @Festival-sb2kf  👍0  2020-08-14
    @arucious yeah that is true but their profit would not. So, they would end up losing profit even if they sell more. Therefore, from Sony's perspective, it is a bad idea.

    ↳ @Festival-sb2kf  👍0  2020-08-14
    @arucious dude says who? Sony definitely is MORE popular than Bose. Bose is an American company and outside of US I literally never see them. Sony on the other hand has a HUGE market. "No world class reputation" lmaoo say that to a company raking in over $76 billion in annual revenue, one of the leaders in film and audio industry and owner of the PlayStation. Bose has a measly $4 billion, pocket change. Most music makers label through Sony Studios.

They worked out fine. I like the Bose simple features better but they seem too fragile to me for the price. I have broken Bose before but these WH10000 are holding up.

I owned these a few months ago and now I have some thoughts. 
I thought these were amazing when I first bought them, couldn't believe how good they sounded. Even in those early days though, sometimes I thought "jee I just wish it was slightly clearer" but because I spent so much on them I just assumed this is about as good as it got and just got used to it.
Then however I found a great youtuber called crinacle and he kinda slagged on them a bit, basically calling them beats and that's when it all started falling apart, what I'd be slightly feelng previous was now perfectly crystalised and it's issues of the bass basically bleeding all the way into the mids was unavoidable for me. So I went out and bought a second hand pair of Beyerdynamic DT 990s and instantly the difference was night and day, the DT 990s just were so much clearer with much more detail and were frankly much better tuned. This was just running out of my phone too, no amp or dac yet (which you can do even though they are the 250ohm version). It got to the point where it dawned on me that I'll never use the sonys again so I sold them and haven't looked back since.
 Now this is all to say that they weren't what I was looking for, I was chasing sound quality not a feature rich HEADSET. Most of the features are ones I can live without but that will be on a person to person basis

    @fallinginthed33p so have you used the Sony app to tweak the sound and if so then how does it sound?

    ↳ @fallinginthed33p  👍1  2020-08-14
    @PirtDotato I don't use the app  for EQ because it forces the headphones into SBC mode. Better to EQ on your music player app so you can keep higher bandwidth codecs like AptX HD or LDAC. The XM4 doesn't have AptX unfortunately, only SBC and LDAC and AAC.

    ↳ @PirtDotato  👍9  2020-08-14
    @00O3O1B Dude wait. Think like a normal person

It's a noise cancelling and Bluetooth headphone but I'm asking how good the sound is like if compared to the Bose 700s
And also about what you have misunderstood.
1. Sound quality refers to how clear and accurate the music is (for average people not someone who expects every byte of data to travel through Bluetooth)
2. The music that we listen to or stream online isn't loseless ever (because the formats are always compressed) so the sound quality is always regarding how accurate the sound is without making some tones flat or too shrill...... In your words if listening to garbage music how accurate and clear the sound of the garbage music is.
3. (Active)Noise cancellation does produce a negative wave to cancel out surrounding noise. And it might sometimes interfere with music to an extent that it's perceptible to human ear. And if active noise cancellation was really bad that it disrupted the original music then people wouldn't want it any way, it would be like listening to a pilot's radio in a sound proof cabin. 
4. Lossless audio requires lot of space and people generally use mp3 or something like that instead of lossless FLACs
5. Sony uses mp3 and other compressed audio formats and fills in the gaps to make it sound like lossless and although it doesn't meet the standards as good as studio monitors do but is quite good for a Bluetooth headphone that uses mp3 instead of lossless as the source.
6. Most importantly sound quality when people ask for is about how clear and rich the sound is if u know what I mean. Like Bose has an in built equalizer that automatically adjusts the audio for a rich experience and if u ask people then obviously Bose has better sound quality than Sony (not technical sound quality but the overall music experience they get).
7. The channel doesn't describe about the audio is how bass heavy or clear, etc.(agreed)... But when people want to know about the sound quality then they DON'T  ask if these can produce highest quality sound without missing the data, rather how good they sound against their competitors like the Bose 700...
It was a totally different question for your answer.

Loved these headphones, wish the right earcup didn't make a high pitched noise that can cause permanent hearing loss and messes with the sound in just the right ear when I turn on ANC. Everything else about these headphones has been stellar, but my story it similar to do many other people. Bought the XM4s, worked great for a year or two, then they start making this noise. I hate to say it but I'm probably not gonna buy Sony again, especially since they (to my knowledge at least) haven't addressed this issue at all.

    Marshall Carhart The Playstations seem to be one of the few Sony products with names that make sense and make it easy to distinguish between each product in the family (PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PSP, PS VITA, PSX), that and the Xperia Play and Sony's own alkaline batteries...and the Sony Rolly. (ok, so the last 3 don't really count as the Xperia Play is one of the few members of the Xperia family that doesn't have a needlessly complicated name, the Sony Rolly is a lone product so obviously it's easy to distinguish it from other Rollys, and every company that makes Alkaline batteries uses the same naming scheme so it's not really that unique to Sony).

    ↳ @MythicSuns  👍0  2020-08-13
    E. O. not really; the H.ear On family is filled with headphones that have overly complicated names that make it trickier to tell them apart, or even casually bring them up in conversation. Saying "hey, wanna check out my PS4?" requires a lot less syllables than "hey, wanna check out my WH1000XM4s?"

    Is the noice cancellation really that good? Like seriously, is it “that” good? 

I’m a college student studying at home and I’m the type of person who needs it absolutely silent to focus (the smallest sound can disrupt my train of thought). I don’t have a big family and I don’t live in a noisy neighborhood, but voices in the house can get distracting. Other things distract me too, but I don’t want to bother people too much when asking them to keep it down. 

Due to the price, I don’t want to spend all that money if it’s not going to help. Do you guys think it would be worth it? Please let me know.

    Lumut End Is it one of those things that’s just overhyped? I feeling like everywhere you go, people are just _raving_ about these headphones.

    ↳ @sacken  👍17  2020-09-20
    @fate-vs-destiny8239 In general there are some people that just can't use ANC bc it makes them dizzy, gives'em headache and they can't do really anything about it but the vast majority of people has no problem. Anyway the ANC in these headphones is not really THAT good like those "simulatons" on yt show. The sound isn't just 100% gone. ANC is good at blocking sounds of freqeuncies up to 1kHz. Above that it mostly relies on passive noise cancelation of the headphone themselves. Can't say that these Sony's don't block higher freqeuncies because passive cancelation is good itself and ANC is still  canceling sound just not as good as >1kHz. For example if you stand near the  pretty busy road and listen to a song at reasonable sound level you shouldn't hear any noise, it will be gone, without any music, well the sound will be canceled by idk 80% BUT lets say you are at home listening to music at 50% volume (for me thats high enough, anything above 80% is just pain) and your alarm goes on, you will have no problem hearing that. How about the voices? No music or movie and someone stands near you - you will hear them but understanding what they say might be hard, if you turn on the music or a movie, they are gone. For me, these headphones were the best thing I bought in the last 2 years, even though ANC might be just not as good as they say (its still amazing).

    ↳ @lumutend5857  👍0  2020-09-20

    @lumutend5857 that’s an affect that happens with the pressure I’m your ears when noise cancellation is on. That’s why AirPods Pro have an extra sensor. That happens with some people and not with others. So if it happens to you, than yeah don’t buy it

I've been using this for over 3 years now, every day 10+ hours. I really love it, but the microphone is terrible during phone calls. People keep telling me that they can barely hear me, so I often have to take it off for calls. One other issue is, that normally the music should automatically stop playing if I take off the headset, but this function stopped working after about 2 years.

[612] @redmenace3921  👍0  2021-12-07
Let's be honest, their default sound tuning is garbage. 5 band EQ isn't sufficient to correct for it either. A proper harman curve applied to them does wonders, but seriously, they're bad.

Got a pair for Rs.18000 ($220) here in India. ANC feels like magic as when it kick in you get isolated from the surroundings. But when you remove your headphones you'll notice how much noise was being cancelled out. BTW I was torn between XM4 and QC45 but what swayed me towards XM4 was its sensors, eq settings and durabilty.

    ↳ @simpleuserYT  👍1  2022-10-30

I bought a pair of XM2's back in 2016-2017 and they are still going strong(charge/functionality) . I use them everyday at work while I micro-finish parts. Completely gets rid of all the ambient noise in a machine shop. I have so many hours on these its crazy. All ive had to replace was the ear-pads because they were starting to fall apart and de-laminate. I ordered a replacement set of ear pads and they are like brand new again. the hard case is starting to become pretty weathered though.

I got xm3 and they do have multiphone support but you can only do 1 thing at once for example if you turn off phone calls and contact sharing and only keep music you can pair it to your other phone for phone calls and contact sharing so you have 2 devices at once connected but you end up loosing ldac codex when doing that

XM4 buds are so damn good: I just wish someone would make something comparable that would really fit inside the ear so you can still get a newer tight fitting moto helmet on and off. I literally cannot listen to music anymore ever since I upgraded my helmet, and I don't want to buy an additional in helmet system. Riding with wireless buds on the moto was the dream and I miss it. The XM4 buds are so damn good though. They really figured it out with these ones.

I feel that the Sony WH-1000XM4 for ($250 on sale to $350 retail) is so closer to the $500 to $550 AirPods Max that it's really hard to justify spending like 40% more for maybe 5% better performance. For 99% of people the Sony WH-1000XM4 is a fantastic value. You start seeing diminishing returns after about the $350  price range unless you start reaching the 4 digits.

    @sethagastya this is unfortunately true. To have high-fidelity audio, a method of communication between the headset and device cannot use a lossy codec. This is why most headphones that audiophiles like are wired. For day to day listening, however, I enjoy the mark 3s and 4s.

    @heartdyedpurple because super high fidelity headphones themselves would cost about $200 to make, then add in bluetooth, plus the tech to make it noise canceling, plus you need a pretty decent amp if you want it to still be high fidelity whiel over bluetooth and you have a much more expensive headphone.

LDAC is far superior, so the loss of that coupled with their DSE Extreme method to upscale bandwidth makes for a imperceptible different. I dont care nor do I miss that codec.

The wh1000xm4 have a replaceable 3mm jack if you wish to use them with an interface amp. I mean, minijack isn't ideal, but it's an option that yields the flattest reference quality from these and I have actually used them to master my own music projects with great results. It's almost as if you neglect to mention the fact most cannot tell the difference between certain kHz regions for these products to be a good proposition, or practical, but you also neglect to mention the fact LDAC by Bluetooth standards is as good as wired coupled with the latest Bluetooth 5.1 tech. I personally cannot hear the difference with critical listening with above-average hearing. Regardless, there comes a point that audio equipment discourse becomes an exercise is a snobbery opposed to being a genuine reflection of objective performance. You also fail to acknowledge that Sony has been a huge player in the Audio field for decades, so there's that.

Yeah, version 1.0. (I.e. the MDR 1000X). That wasn't the case with subsequent revisions and the design has subtlety changed from materials to the small hinge refinements that may be missed without comparing. Regardless, no majority has winged since the m2's were announced and I had no issues. There's also the issue of mistaking a vocal minority for being the majority. As a general rule, I'd say jsut look after your things regardless. I can attest that they hold up, so I see no reason why these won't, being the refined product it is.

    ↳ @Klffsj  👍1  2020-08-13
    @maksmarkowicz Well, these are bluetooth headphones, designed to be convenient, quality headphones for average listeners, not studio headphones meant for audiophiles. I'm pretty sure Sennheiser doesn't make wireless headphones, and if they did, I'm not sure they would be better than these.

    ↳ @god_cells8035  👍0  2020-08-13

    ↳ @insertnamehere8723  👍1  2020-08-13
    @middaymeds 

Literally no reviewer has ever regarded these as being remotely akin to the muddy and bad anc skullcandy crushers or beats. The criticism I had ascertained was to do with the treble signature with the m3, being a tad harsh with some slight sibblance with critical listening, perhaps bass being unrefined, but never obnoxious- and most, if not all, of those issues have been rectified. Regardless, bass can actually be fun and a pleasing proposition to *average customers*, hence why the skullcandy crushers exist in this price range. Again, these by no means sound bad like the aforementioned examples. With that said, they perform exceptionally where it counts as far as Hi-res ANC goes and have undergone some improvements to the how articulate the bass sounds (now punchier) in the soundstage, as well as refining treble and widening the soundstage more at the expenss of sounding less warm, but that's it. So again, these are actually easily in the top spot and sound detailed enough and exciting enough to win over the most critical listeners. I'd say bowers and Wilkins px7 have the edge somewhat in quality, albeit negligable and lacking in key areas such as sound quality with ANC enabled, which is bad when they're marketed as ANC headphones. So, in summary, they're performing exceptionally well for their price range and cheaper than that of the comparatively boring flagship ANC Bose headphones also. I'd like to ask where you got the impression that any 350-400 pair of headphones wouldn't have a v shaped sound signature lmfao. Anyways, the points they aren't bad so there it is🤷🏻‍♂️.

    @insertnamehere8723 I wasn't criticizing the xmX line at all, or saying that it failed to provide wired audio options. What I was merely saying is that others prefer the lossless connection that a wire has to Bluetooth and the reason why it was preferred. I never once stated that I wish this option was available because I know about it. I was also adding to a comment that was already made and helping back it up. I really do enjoy the xm3 and xm4 and use a pair of them on a daily basis.

In that case you're actually the minority because there hasn't been any public outrage about this "issue" since the first. So, I didn't 'get lucky', I just got what I payed for and expected: quality.

    ↳ @insertnamehere8723  👍2  2020-08-13
    @SeanGonzalezMDHEXT 

Accept you agree that you can't get hi res and bluetooth, which is incorrect. There's no perceptive difference and you absolutely can get hi res with LDAC, hence my comment. I also pointed out that, if preferred, a wire can be used as well as to conserve battery. The point is you aren't missing out, because otherwise the hi-res audio badge would be false advertising and there would be some outrage if people eho test these confirmed that. Alas, that is not the case. Again, I have used both the wired and the Bluetooth (LDAC codec) with absolutely no difference or detriment when put in Bluetooth mode. Anyway, you technically won't get hi res, even with ridiculously expensive gear, if you use lossy formats such as mp3n or the worst of all: streaming. It's unlikely most have access to flac or wav files to benefit, but I will also say most probably wouldn't spot the difference and the DSEE extreme with LDAC is very impressive at upscaling, with wired then obviously being a non issue regardless, since it doesn't need to use any middle man, so to speak.

    @insertnamehere8723 incorrect, I believe that high-res audio can be delivered through wireless means. I was simply explaining why some specific people don't like wireless audio, and, the truth is that LDAC is high-res. The one and only reason people don't like wireless is because, for data to be transmitted wirelessly, it has to be put through a lossy encoding scheme. This is why most audiophiles tend to stay away from wireless audio, and, as far as I can tell, DSEE will work like in the XM3 with the codec having to be AAC or SBC to use it. LDAC and DSEE, as far as I can tell, cannot be used at the same time.

You explained poorly and I'd say your comment was downright contradictory and unclear at best.

They aren't and nothing in any review or forums concurs with that, so that seems like your anecdotal stance is somewhat clouding your judgment based on what happened to you alone. You're entitled to tell people, dont get me wrong, but not to assert that is undeniably a reality with buying these, because that just isn't true and would be dishonest/ bordering on intentuonal misrepresentation otherwise. Again, I'm pretty sure the Internet, in its annoying, vocal glory, would have made this "issue" know if it were widespread. However, as it stands, it has been exactly 3 generations in since the first and only widespread incident of cracking hinges-- so you can excuse me for taking that with a pinch of salt in the grand scheme of things, since that would be a glaring oversight with a prevuously known issue that has been adressed/ rectified, for all intents and purposes

The only way they’ll fix something is if there’s public outcry.

    @iownu92 

I never disputed that was, however, I'm more than familiar with what a consensus is and this isn't it. Also Searching for cracks from reviews or forums only serves to act as a confirmation bias in this context. If there was really a widespread issue, then of course I would take note, but I and many more are of the persuasion that there isn't an issue and that these odd cases are just by the by of a circumstantial issue in a small portion of users, as unfortunate as that is. Again, comparatively, the gen 1 models had huge criticism following a glaring issue and it was adressed, for all intents and purposes; This is not that. There are also many variables which may affect plastic durability in regards to manufacturing of plastic,  and plastic anything may be affected consequently, but there's little to go off outside of a vocal minority as it stands. My hypothesis is that a plastic moulded and cooled to quickly may prove to be more fragile and this can happen, regardless of the design. I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to the design without obviously being the designer. Regardless, I have seen numerous stress tests that have yelled no breakage concurring with the idea this is an anomaly. The gen 2 and 3 weren't panned by the majorty the same way the gen 1's were, just to emphasise that for you and put it into perspective.

    @maksmarkowicz I don’t think there are any wireless ANC headphones on the market that sounds compare to something like a 650, especially for $400.

    ↳ @sergejkeser7270  👍1  2021-09-27
    Sound quality is a bit better than average, but in reality, nothing special. They are pretty muffled and havy on bass, especially if you are already in a quiet room. So if you want something closer to the reference sounding headphones that you can sort of use for critical listening, these are not for you. However, the noise cancelling is amazing, even without ANC enabled. And that is their selling point. So if you are all about that, than these are for you.

But if you want that good, wide, hi-fi sound but on the go, and you dont need the supreme ANC, portability and wireless approach, but just simply some close back headphones that block sound on their own, there are better alternatives.

But again, if portability, wirelless and ANC are your main thing, you CAN NOT go wrong with these, they are amazing! Just a bit too bassy with not quite enough clarity in the mids and highs. But again, some people like that the most.

Remember, these are all nit-picks, because these are so god damn close to just being perfect!

Great review (as always). The design is understated, yet still pretty classy IMO. I agree with what you said. I'm a big Sony snob since I'm in radio and wear the MDR-7506's for my job each day on-air and they represent the industry standard for most realistic audio reproduction, and they sound great. I did what you said and ordered the XM3's since they are now cheaper, yet offer so much of what the XM4's do and since I never use multi-point, I'm good.

I like these. The sounds solid. But these seem to handle sweat really bad. It's been hit here in California and I'm just wearing them while I game. And I think even when I plug them into my controller it drains the battery very fast. And the bass is good and clear and crisp but you can't really "feel" it. I think I might return these and go back to VModa.

    Sony makes the best audio smartphones, along with LG. Xperia 1 II is the only smartphone with a 4k display and I think it's very underrated, at least it comes with a headphone jack a freaking charger in the box unlike some, rest of their line up is nothing special but not terrible(well besides the Pro). Their cameras are just the best. Their headphones are sometimes gold (1000XM3, SHP9500, Fidelio X2HR, MDR-1A) and otherwise ehhhhhh. Their TV marketshare is just behind LG and Samsung. They're pretty good for the most part, but usually not the greatest. Oh yeah and there's still the playstation, but that's a duopoly anyway.

    ↳ @Jonathon29  👍0  2021-04-03
    @fclp67What are you on about? Sales is not a factor in if a product is quality or not. No one cares about smartphone speakers and a 4k display. The human eye can’t tell the difference in quality and no one is watching movies on a tiny screen. Sony TV’s are great. The main reason Sony tv’s aren’t as popular is because LG and Samsung sell an equal or better product at a mid range level. 

Also, the Nintendo Switch was the most sold console in 2020. It’s not a duopoly market...

This smells like a video game update/patch, not like a brand new version with a number 4. More like 3.5. At least the 3 version got super cheap because of this one. Might be a good time to pick another pair.  If anything, i'm more curious and excited about MX5. What would they do? Longer battery? Even better build quality + sound quality? Sign me up for those.

    ↳ @jrrichards9392  👍0  2020-08-26
    Better ANC is also a big plus. Ear pads supposed to be 10 percent bigger which may be ideal for my giant ears.  I would like a better build quality as well for 350.

This is a great pair of headsets but small life, and extraordinary "BAD" customer support. Just 8 months use and wear sensor has no effect, the battery is thus always LOW and the most famous click-click telescopic headband is loose...Now SONY customer care seems to be the boss and why would a boss listen to anybody!

There's one thing the Bose headphones can do that the Sonys don't,
and it could be a deal-breaker for some.
You can connect the Bose headphones to two devices at the same time with Bluetooth, which was great for seamlessly switching between the connection with my phone and the connection with my computer.
Shockingly, the Sonys don't let you do that — they can be connected to only one device at a time. 
It was more of a hassle to switch between devices than it was with the Bose headphones.

    ↳ @kieransimpson4965  👍0  2021-12-29
    He says in the video that you can do that with the sonys? You can pair to more than one device

    ↳ @urimandara  👍0  2021-12-29
    @kieransimpson4965 Sony can be paired to several devices simultaneously but if you are connected to PC and you are listening to music and there is an incoming cellular call - Bose will switch automatically to phone and pause PC music . after call ends Bose will return to PC automatically and turn music on . 

Sony can  NOT  do it  automatically  , you should  do it manually and its pretty annoying ! 
also in Bose at incoming call you here notification in headphones .  
Sony will NOT notify you 
so if the phone is not near you , you just will not hear the call because of noise cancelation  : )))))

[771] @keith3studorg458  👍0  2022-04-20
Is the pausing when placing your hand over the ear cup-feature designed for turning the music off in the case of pulling one ear cup away from your head, the way most people would if they were talking to someone? Or does the wear detection feature automatically pause the music if you pull one ear cup away from your head slightly, as in just enough to have a conversation?

[772] @dzyanw  👍0  2021-11-22
Just got these and they sound great, with awesome noise cancelling, especially compared to the H900n.
But I was hoping the multi pair feature would let me pair to my laptop and phone to have them both play media at the same time. Unfortunately this is not the case, as it will designate the phone purely for calls. So hope they can do that via a software update <.< That way I can have YouTube open on my phone and work on my laptop and then easily switch in between whenever I feel like it without having to disconnect on my laptop just to have audio come in from my phone.

Also thanks for the review Marques & crew!

    ↳ @dzyanw  👍1  2021-11-22
    So, seemingly it works now, but the trick is that it won't play media from 2 sources at the same time, so one needs to be explicitly paused, before the other source feeds audio into the headphones, and there's a couple seconds in between before audio from the other source starts playing. But hey, this is way better than having to add a wire to my laptop and switching that way 👌🏼

You might be wondering why my review is negative out of many other positive reviews. Trust me, the only  good thing about these headphones is the sound quality, and probably its build quality. For a product that is advertised as a premium product it has major flaws which are a dealbreaker for me. 
It doesn’t have basic functionality, like the ability to switch between bluetooth devices, so when you turn them on and they randomly get connected with one of your devices, and then you’ll have to manually find which one and turn them off. 
It doesn’t have the  feature to autopause music when you take them off or even the feature to automatically turn off when kept idle, unless ofcourse you are willing to clean the sensor every now and then. Once the sensor gets slightly dirty, it won’t detect whether you are wearing them or not, and hence will not auto pause or turn them off automatically, and before you know it you’ll be left with battery dead headphones.

In comparison Apple Airpods pro are a perfect example of why consumer convenience matters the most. Even more than sound quality in my opinion.

    Me too! I kept holding out on over-ear headphones to see if Apple would ever release some. I was willing to drop around $350 for them...

    These sounds like crap against the Airpods Max

    ↳ @mosiah9205  👍111  2020-12-31
    @MrAlex-lk8zn But are the AirPods Max really sound roughly $300 better? Including the case issues, etc.?

I'm not knocking the AirPods Max quality at all. I'm sure that they're incredible. I just don't believe that, when compared to the xm4's, it's worth it to spend ANOTHER $300 or so MORE for the Pods Max.

Apple is great, I'm a huge fan. I have an Apple Watch, iPhone Pro Max, and MacBook Pro. I've budgeted to buy these products without feeling guilty - I've saved a bit and did research with comparable products. With these headphones, I just don't think that the price is worth it.

The XM4's are incredible. They're convenient, they come with a hard case, and they have amazing capabilities. To me, it's a no-brainer. If I had a TON of disposable income, then perhaps it would be a different story, but I don't.

    ↳ @MrAlex-lk8zn  👍7  2020-12-31
    @mosiah9205 actually I think the AirPod Max is worth the extra bucks
Everything about it is so close to perfection. Build quality, much much better sound quality (Sony has always have a bad history with treble and details) better noise cancelation. And the main thing /Soundstage/
Just the case is absolute garbage lol


Edit: I just noticed my idiotic spelling.

    ↳ @ESGamingCentral  👍9  2021-01-01
    @MrAlex-lk8zn I agree to some regard with some of your statements, but on my end I don't label those limitations as "crap". This field is very subjective, my favorite headphones are HD650

I'm not afraid to call famous headphones crappy 
I personally love JBL portable bluetooth speakers, but there was this one time, I got my hands on a pair of JBL headphones, I believe it was Everett something. The amount of bass is insane and with it, the treble was  distorted and crappy. This Sony definitely sounded better than the JBL headphones that I tried but it's still not up to par with the balanced sound Apple offer with the Por Pros and Pod Max.

These have more convinsing bass and overall performance, maxes did sound pretty clear but really not exiting and they were quite heavy.
There's no power off button on Maxes, which is just stupid, they are on all the time or low power mode but still on.

No they don't sound "incredible".. average at best. Honestly, the sony WI C 200 sound on par with these (the eq when turned off on XM4 is even shittier, but I set a custom eq that is slightly better than their wireless headphones that are literally 20x cheaper). Noise cancelling is the best though. All the other features work fine. Not worth it if you want quality sound.

Sony only offers a 1 Year Warranty for these headphones, and after only a little over a year the microphone began interfering with the noise canceling, causing a loud wail/whine sound. This is an unfortunately common problem. 

Warranty periods shouldn't be overlooked when doing these reviews. If a company has confidence in the build their product, they would provide a longer warranty.

I just bought the headphones yesterday and when I was testing it my phone I was a bit disappointed. The sound wasn't loud enough and It isn't as good as I thought it'd be. I though maybe it's fake because I bought it online but everything seems too legit. I bought it from a tested seller and there were no red flags when I was unboxing it.

Today, I was testing the dual bluetooth connection and connect it to my laptop. I was hearing music on spotify using my laptop and I realized that the sound quality is really good and the loudness is really satisfying. I changed it to my phone (using spotify) and the loudness was not satisfying. It turns out my phone is the problem. Idk much about electronics but I guess the better the device the better the sound. I don't really see the need to have an expensive phone because I don't really need it. So, I have a 2017 (been using since 2018) $200 (back then) samsung phone that is exclusively for certain asian countries that usually can't afford expensive phones. My laptop on the other hand cost me $1100 and has dolby atmos speakers. So, from this I just assumed that the better the device the better the sound but idk for sure. 

Can someone explain why it sounds better on my laptop but not on my phone?

    ↳ @jame5game5  👍0  2022-02-04
    I don't know much, but it probably has to do with the software where you listen to your music from. If not that, then you just need a higher quality phone.

    ↳ @jame5game5  👍0  2022-02-04
    Dolby  atmos helps

    ↳ @leander1859  👍0  2022-02-07
    These use high quality codecs like AAC. Which is very nice on Apple phones, not so much on Android. Since you have a Samsung the older XM3 would have probably better for you, those support aptX and generally give better sound quality on Android devices. Bit disappointing he doesn't mention this in his review.

    ↳ @jame5game5  👍0  2022-02-07
    @leander1859 Really ? So how do I know if an Android phone has good codec ?

    ↳ @leander1859  👍0  2022-02-07
    @jame5game5 I believe almost all Android phones have aptX nowadays. It's an audio Bluetooth codec to deliver the same sound quality you'd expect from wired headphones. When you buy a bluetooth headphone it's important to look for compatibility. So for the best sound quality on an Android you'd generally want to look for a headset that supports aptX, for Apple that's AAC. Now there is also aptX HD and aptX Adaptive which are the better versions of aptX. I know Samsungs have their own codec. So they don't support aptX HD/Adaptive, only aptX. But most other newer Androids do have the HD/Adaptive codecs. Like Pixel, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Sony, Motorola, LG, Nokia etc. Long story haha but if you're not sure I'd recommend to just google around a bit.

    ↳ @leander1859  👍0  2022-02-07
    @jame5game5 Usually when you pair your headphone it automatically chooses the best codec. But you can check the codec options (while paired) in your developer settings, under Bluetooth audio codec.

[865] @Mambo56783  👍17  2020-08-14
Three changes I would have liked to see:
- Having one separate 'custom' button instead of having either NC on/off and smart assistant on the same. I would have loved to be able to use both functions.
- You should be able to turn NC off as default. Then use the button to turn it on as needed. Instead the default is that NC always turns on when the headphones are switched on.
- The headphone notifications completely silence whatever sound is playing from the bluetooth source. So when NC kicks in you cannot hear a podcast for about 1-2 seconds. It should blend the two so that you can keep up with what's said. It's even more annoying when on a phone call since you are basically missing a full sentence.

Otherwise. An almost perfect product (love my XM2's).

    ↳ @synologix  👍1  2020-08-15
    On the XM3's you can access the smart assistant by holding one finger on the touchpad for some time. Maybe the XM2's have that too? Then you can use the button for NC on/off and the touchpad for smart assistant so you can use both easily.

Btw I totally agree with you on the headphone notification, I always have to pause the video I'm watching so I don't miss anything. It's a bit annoying

    @okene Hi, any type of crackling sound in the headphones means it's defective. First pair I got had a discernible crackling sound in the right ear cup and I exchanged for another pair that doesn't have that issue. This problem occurs more in Amazon purchases for some reason.

Just got my XM4's on sale for $200. Super happy. I like that they are LOUD too. So many newer headphones are barely loud at all; I don't always want my music bumping, but when I do, I want to able to turn it up! My previous pair of JBL's were just at full volume all the time, and while they were pretty good for sound (they also cost waaaay less), they were never going to be considered loud. Like Marcus says, the NC is incredible, and it really makes things peaceful when you need it.

BIG COMPARISON (New and old ones): * Panasonic Technics A800 (owner) vs * Sony MX4 (tested 7 days) vs * Bose QC45 (owner) vs * Panasonic RB-M700BE (owner 5x) vs * Sony MDR-XB950 (Ex-Owner) vs * Sony WHXB910N (tested) : Every headphone has its weaknesses and its strengths :

The Panasonic Technics A800 has very good sound and ANC and it's general volume and bass volume is much stronger and powerfull compared to Sony MX4 or Bose QC45. MX4 and QC45 are pretty the same in sound and ANC. QC45 has better software than MX4. The A800 software is in the level of QC45. The ANC of the Panasonic Technics A800 is much better than on Bose QC45 (And a lot of people say the QC45 has a little bit better ANC than MX4, so that means A800 has to be the best ANC on market at the moment) only exeption heavy vibrations from steps or public transportation... The Panasonic (A800 & RB-M700B) ANC has problems with that... 

The ANC of the RB-M700B is worse but not that much worse than the others. When ANC is deactivated the RB-M700B has the best overall sound imo ! The RB-M700B is the only one you think you have a subwoofer ! That's because it has a spring vibration system (bass reaktor). To listen my favorite music (genre electronic music and techno) and war games with a lot of bassy explosions I prefer to use the Panasonic RB-M700B. I really love the bass reactor vibration system very very very much !!!! It is the only one that feels like you have a 2.1 subwoofer hifi system. On the others new on market you thnink you have a bass weak 2.0 system. Also the mids and highs are good. I have a total of 5x RB-700's (3x from warehouse 75-85€) to be sure i got great music hp for next 10 years. (I’m engineer i can replace batteries if storage at optimal voltage is not much enough). Because I live at to places I want minimum 4 head phones (you always need 2 when one is discharged take to other… permanent change…). So this matches nicely. I hope Panasonic will continue to offer and develop headphones with bass reactor vibration system because I can't listen to techno and electronic music on head phones without a bass reactor anymore. The Sony MDR-XB950N1 Extra Bass head phones from 2017 have a bass reactor vibration system (my first head phones i had with a bass vibration system) but the new Sony WHXB910N Extra Bass from 2021 don't has a bass vibration system anymore imo. 

I use public transportation and have a very very very permanent noisy neighbor that is the reason I needed something more than the RB-M700B. I use the Bose QC45 for public transportation and the Panasonic Technics A800 for watching TV or silent video games at home when the neighbour is very loud (the A800 can better reduce noises from neighboor than the QC 45, bassy step noises and others).

After a 2 years of using these, they now have a high pitched ringing noise when noise canceling is on. This has happened to many other people also. I don’t trust Sony anymore and I’m switching to Bose for now on. If u read this, it’s just a warning that it might happen to you.

I am confused! Your post from last year said the Bose 700 were the top of line for noise cancellation. I have tried these and 3 version and they have cancelled out a thing. I still hear my neighbors and all the banging. So which is it???? As your posts are WIDLY contradicting each other.

Review after use:

I just trew these across the room with a nice velocity, and they will never be able to be repaired again.. perfect.

First 2 weeks of use, showed signes of incorrect noicecancelling engineering, where crackling and screeching sounds made me almost have tinittus, so loud I  threw them off my head, repair service couldn't find anything, so I just didn't use noise cancel mode, after another year, the touchpad started tweaking out, going on pause every half a second, spamming next song, or volume up, down anything, changing modes, so I disabled the touchpart. another half a year later (1,5 in total) The battery was starting to act out, and stuff, and now the battery, and charging port are done for.

I can only use it with a 3.5mm jack....

Man fuck this technology, just give me a simpler item, where less points of failure are.

Honesty over the period of using this headphone, I honestly wish I just threw 250 euro away, and not get the headphones, the amount of times these headphones failed me when I needed them, gave me more frustration worth 250 euro...

I won't be buying headphones again with much tech, so basicly I won't be wearing them anymore i guess... I just want a product that works goddamn.

I wanted to go with Apple but not for $500 and reviews the Sony did better, so glad I went with the xm4's ! had them almost a year now and love everything about them. I will see for extreme workouts like if you constantly jumping up and down or bending over the AirPods Pro will do better because the xm4 will slide off, but literally everything else the xm4 destroys AirPods Pro, in sound, noise cancellation, batter life, and also you don't have to work about cleaning that nasty ear wax every so often. I will say ears do get sweaty but again I d rather just wipe down the muffs then have to constantly clean the AirPods. No hate on AirPods I love them and love how you can go between noise cancellation modes but I like the xm4's better.

    Sad time to tell you hat the wh5s look sick and come out this year

    ↳ @GGNext1  👍13  2022-05-01
    @Sheetza Not sad at all.  I've had enough tech fails to learn to let the reviewers play with things for 6 months or so before buying.  Bendable iPhones, exploding samsung phones, Google Glass, and the Pixel 6 Pro debacle, have all taught me of the wisdom of not jumping on day 1 products.  From MKBHD, the headphones that the mark 4's replaced were almost identical, except for talk to mute (not great) and multiple device pairing (decent), and didn't recommend an upgrade even then unless those specific features are needed.  Thanks for the heads up, but I waited a while for these, and I'll be find waiting a while for reviewers to actually recommend the 5s.  The 4s had a 1 year breaking review of daily wear with no breaking down of the soft cups or headband, no cracking, no marking, nothing, so until the 5s get that, I'm good.  But thanks for the heads up. ;)

    @DarcyWhyte Yeah I hear you. There are other options with the USB dongle like the new Voyager Focus 2 UC that are around the $300 mark. That said, if the Bose headset is preferred then the Bose Link Adapter is highly recommended.

Thank you so much for this review - I'm considering buying a pair, and the demos of voice quality with background noise filter, etc are very helpful.

1. Could you please mention whether it can be used while charging? Is it limited to aux/wired mode while charging? Can it be used in bluetooth mode while charging?
2. Would you be able to do a test with someone talking on their phone, sitting in the seat next to you, or on the couch behind you?

I decided to make an impulse purchase and get the XM4's on sale for $200! I currently have Anker Soundcore Q20i's, which have been great value. I'm looking forward to see just how much better the XM4s' sound quality and noise cancelling is though! Funny how multi-device support was only added on the XM4's, this has been a super nice feature even on my Q20i's. It can sometimes be slightly finicky though so I'm hoping it's better on the XM4's. I did also think about getting the XM5's, and while the vegan leather material and it being super comfortable sounds nice, and the improved noise cancelling and sound quality would have been great, I don't love the look and the price, and it not being as portable is really not optimal.

I bought a pair in March after I spent 3 months listening to every noise cancelling set of headphones at the shop I work in. My only regret is that I didn't buy the blue pair they released a while ago and got the black ones instead (I live in Phoenix, it gets sweaty). Other than that,  I use them literally every day and they're hands down the smartest purchase I've made since I bought myself a Macbook pro when I was 17. I will definitely be staying up to date with whatever over-ear headphones Sony releases from here on out. These are so good I'm struggling to see how they can improve them for the eventual XM5... Maybe deeper ear cups and easily changeable pads like the Bose 700s? It could be nice to see a little more metal engineered into hinges and other failure points in the design, too, though I've said 1000 times you're tempting fate to not use the carry case they include. My only other suggestion would be to make the ear cups able to swivel in both directions.

So are the hardware they are built with any good or is it just firmware tricks and driver updates to make them sound better than what there was, they should sound and function flawlessly out of the box without software needed. the Amp or AV sources make the sound input changes not updates. that's a new one to me, updates for headphone's, what if ppl don't have means to update, 350 spent for lack lustre quality and returned fast, £350 for Sony's , i want Bose for that money or studio open backed, So sorry for ranting good vid all same, informative as usual, just not feeling them sony's

    Yeah, they're pretty amazing for atmospheric open world games. However, I think for multiplayer games like COD or Apex, you should get a pair of gaming headphones

Would you guys recommend this model for someone who is using them mainly for the noise cancelling feature without wanting to listen to music all the time ? I have a SEVERE case of misophonia and our neighbours stomping sounds from upstairs have been driving me crazy and I'm also allergic to like 90% of other sounds ( I do have other tools to deal with chewing/eating/etc sounds). I do love listening to music but that's not why I want to buy a new pair of headphones. I was wondering if these are worth buying for the purpose I have in mind

    ↳ @uguryigit8453  👍0  2023-02-24
    Hi Maady. I don't know if I have misophonia, but it's hard for me to even when I study in the library, and there are two friends next to me discussing a question with a little tiny voice. I've been watching tons of review videos and reading comments, and I guess XM5(NOT XM4) is even doing a better job than XM4. I am about to buy XM5. So I was wondering if you had XM4 or something else. Any ideas, comments, and suggestions are more than welcome! I'll let you know as soon as I get XM5

[1048] @garytan3876  👍0  2021-10-04
There is a compatibility issue when using the XM4 with Samsung TVs. Occasionally, the audio will stutter and lags a couple of seconds from the video. Seems like it is a known problem since XM4 was launched. The new firmware 2.5.0 did not solve the issue. Sony support says that they are not able help with compatibility issues. Those who will be purchasing the XM4 to pair with Samsung TVs, please take note. Unfortunately, I just bought the XM4 last week with the sole purpose of using it with Netflix on my Samsung TV.

There's an option where if you hold with two fingers you can enable/disable the speak-to-chat feature. I think it turns it from a gimmick to a much more useful feature than the palm thing. Now you can just activate it with a gesture when you know you might be talking to people and deactivate it right after so you don't have to worry about it going off. Honestly haven't tried in practice yet though.

    "Buyer's remorse is an example of post-decision dissonance, where a person is stressed by a made decision and seeks to decrease their discomfort." Watching a review that gives the purchased product a good rating reduces cognitive dissonance because you've increased its perceived value (idea 1) vs purchase price (idea 2). Cognitive dissonance is simply discomfort between two competing ideas. Just pay attention to your feelings after you watch the review to see if this is true.

I’ve have bought 2 since they have been released and over a period of time both ended up making this high pitched  squealing sound in the right speaker, sort of like microphone feedback. I’ve research the problem and some say it’s due to moister. I don’t sweat wearing these, although they do tend to get hot after a while, so mayBe that’s why they end up making that feedback sound.

As a blind individual the extra features that would seem gimmicky to most people are actually extremely useful. Especially having a headphone that pauses or lowers volume of music when conversations begin. Taking out my phone and attempting to hit pause or trying to figure out which rocker is the volume can be frustrating. The noise cancling  is super important with anxiety which a lot of blind individuals experience due to all the noises around us. So having better ambient noise filtration helps with dangerous situations like crossing streets.

    ↳ @Lonehawk2k4  👍35  2020-08-14
    unless the mult-connect or improved mics are important to you you're not missing that much. music quality from what i can tell from reviewers i've seen that's done comparisons between the 3 and 4 is pretty minimal and that message has been consistent. Also hearing the same thing from buyers that have gotten their hands on it in europe since for whatever the US didn't its release at the same time

    Same. The 3s are pretty fucking dope still. Is multi point connectivity really worth 50-100 bucks? It'd be nice but I'd rather keep the cash

    I bought M3 last year and no hard feeling when M4 came out.
M4 is an improved version of M3. There is no big improvement that I really needed.
I just need a noise-cancelling headphone that good enough to handle the plane engine noise and M3 is doing damn good.

    ↳ @juliohernandez9372  👍0  2020-08-14
    I got the M3s a few months ago and I'm still extremely happy with them. I dont like the new headband, it sticks out a lot more on the sides and minimal form factor is very important to me. The ability to pair two things at once is the only thing I'd like, but its not a deal breaker for me.

Great review.  With recent pre black Friday sales pricing placing the XM4's within $30 of the XM3's your video helped me decide on the XM4's.  I was also looking at the Shure Aonic 50's, but the Sony's seem so much more portable.

I have the XM3 and I've been happy with them overall but theyre out of warranty now and theyve developed a white noise crackle type noise from the left earcup only on ANC. So I hate to get burned twice and buy the Sony's again, albeit a newer version. But Bose 700 has dealbreaker features that cant be disabled (auto off with motion detect...cant sleep or meditate in them) and I think the sound quality isn't as good in the Bose either. Considering Bowers and Wilkins PX7 or Sony XM4. Still want wireless and ANC but need to be able to travel with them but overall sound quality for music is a big factor.
So few reviews focus on sound quality.

    ↳ @HeadsetAdvisor  👍0  2021-05-18
    That is a great insight that a lot of people overlook. We have many customers who say the same thing so we always recommend headsets that have a USB dongle. The Bose 700 UC and the new Poly Focus 2 UC are a couple of options worth looking at. We did in depth reviews and mic tests on both. If you are using these for computer based applications like softphones and video meetings etc then definitely get a headset with a USB dongle!

    It's a product with different features, like how work so well with Apple products; the material and the fact that the ear cuffs just come off. 

Yes, it's more expensive, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it. It just depends if the way it syncs with other Apple products are worth it for you or not...

You don't need to insult other products just to make this sound better. There are different pros and cons to both products.

    Like em?

    ↳ @DJa1004  👍3  2021-01-14
    @Ghost-jy9hk So, the overall experience is awesome. But since these are my first ANC headphones, I'd not be able to rate them against their competitors. I'm going to try and explain my experience to you based on the following aspects which are the most fundamental ones:
1. Build quality and design -  Absolutely fantastic. They feel premium and are very minimal. Black ones look sick, trust me. You could stare at 'em all day.

2. Sound quality - The fact that MKBHD doesn't even have to talk about the sound quality speaks volumes. They sound incredible. The sound stage is incredible. You will be able to feel the thumping of those Travis Scott songs' beats. But don't disappoint yourself by listening to a lot of Spotify on these headphones. The songs on Spotify are not high quality audio files. Try and download your music to enjoy these. 

3. Active Noise Cancellation - I haven't been able to put ANC to its true test since I've been using them indoors. I haven't been able to use them outside just yet. But ANC does what it says. Cancels out all the white noise. Only ANC on -- you could hear people talk but the sound will be extremely muffled. ANC on + Music on -- you won't hear a thing.

I love 'em. I think you won't regret buying them. But that would also depend on how much you get them for. 

Hope this helps.

    ↳ @Ghost-jy9hk  👍2  2021-01-14
    @DJa1004 that’s awesome to hear man. I had to write off AirPods max for a number of reasons and I can’t stand ear buds anymore. The AirPods Pro gave me 4 infections last year. So I’ve been looking for a good over the ear that’s comfortable with good sound quality and this sounds like it fits the bill. 

The only thing I’m gonna really miss from my AirPods is auto switching. I can connect to two devices at the same time on the Sony’s right? Is that easy to manage?

Thanks for the informative review.  I'm a low-tech senior, currently have the Bose QC25 which are wired.  Didn't want wireless where you had to charge battery but find the Sony's a worthy option.

    ↳ @Wylie288  👍0  2022-04-05
    do NOT buy these. They have a similar sound profile to the original beats. Very over powered bass, with the cost of terribly muddy mids and highs. Your current set is league's ahead. Don't listen to mainstream youtubers, look at the graphs. You can see how a headphone sounds without listening. They sound awful. Go look.

    @Mushfique13 I think it depends why you want them, the noise cancelling is great, I really enjoy that they connect to two devices, the sound quality is great, they've been great for taking calls as well and all the little extra features are a lot of fun (covering the ear cup to chat, messing with the eq). I got them having just finished my master's and going into a new job, and for me they were definitely worth the money because all the features work well for me because I'm working from home

    ↳ @safskatoon  👍1  2021-09-12

But I really want an upgrade soon! An immersive one at that haha. And was thinking of getting these Sony ones in the video. 

I don’t actually care too much about the noise canceling aspect. I really just want a super crisp and high quality sound. The sound is the main thing I’m looking for. Have these headphones really delivered in that area for you?

    @Joesizzle442344 psst here's a quick little insider information. The Airpod Max are marketed as luxury goods/luxury tech. The people that are the target demographic of luxury goods aren't impacted by the "bad economic time" to a degree where they would need to second guess a 550 dollar purchase to start with.

    ↳ @darkpill  👍1  2020-12-14
    Sorry can’t even look at plastic shit anymore. They are for the commoners.

    ↳ @damifash758  👍0  2020-12-14
    @ElementalLeaf lol they are still overpriced tho ...
Coming from someone who is fully invested in the eco system...
These cost almost the same as my AirPods Pro and watch SE...
And I doubt the ANC is even better than xm4

    ↳ @ElementalLeaf  👍0  2020-12-14
    @damifash758 You can be in the Apple ecosystem without being the target demographic of luxury goods. You see how you compared its cost to being the same as the airpod pro and the apple watch (in other words, you're trying to say how significant it is)? I would compare its cost to being roughly half as much as a tshirt I would buy. Do you see the difference we approach this product with? When you can approach this product in that way, you're part of the target demographic. When you talk about it in the way that you did, you're not part of the target demographic. We're both still part of the Apple ecosystem though.

    ↳ @damifash758  👍0  2020-12-15
    @ElementalLeaf what you say make sense 

But if thier target demographic was ppl who buy $1000 shirts 
Then they won’t be making this many units will they ....

They expect the same ppl who have iPhones and AirPods Pro..Apple Watch 
Etc who want an over ear headphone to also get these and for what they offer they are overpriced...

They might cost half of what my shirt is ...but if they cost 2 times the price of similar products they are overpriced 

Same way my dad won’t buy Apple wheels for $600 even tho he has shoes that cost twice that....
Simply because they are overpriced and regardless of budget just don’t make sense ...

And unless the AirPods max has some class leading features other than ecosystem integration....regardless of budget constraints they are overpriced

    ↳ @ElementalLeaf  👍0  2020-12-15
    @damifash758 You call into question the supply but consider two things:

One - these are not perishable items. IF Apple thinks they've overestimated their market, they can easily alter the prices in the future to reflect that, either via sales or permanent markdowns. 

Two - as it is they're underproduced if anything because the preorders of these alone have gone beyond 4 months of available supply now with the product slated to launch in a few hours but sold out until beyond April. Which means Apple has not overpriced them compared to demand from their target demographic.

    What do you mean by that? The XM4s win on so many points such as comfort, pricing, CODEC support, etc.. The Airpods Max wins because it has "That stupid case!" 👍

    ↳ @darkpill  👍0  2021-02-06
    @massamune70 they don’t win on noise cancelation, comfort, replacing ear pads, and spacial audio and connectivity.

    ↳ @massamune70  👍0  2021-02-06
    @darkpill The Airpods are hardly comfortable based on their sheer weight. I'm only guessing but one would probably have to replace the headphones due to a diminished battery before the earpads need  replacing. Spatial audio, not really a game changer for me. As for connectivity, I have zero issues on my iPhone. As for Multipoint Connectivity, my XM4s have no issues switching between my PC and iPhone. I really don't have any reason to buy a  pair of Maxs. Besides, the Max case is horrendous.

    ↳ @darkpill  👍0  2021-02-06
    @massamune70 Maybe you can’t handle the weight because of your girly head? Regardless, the reviews are unanimous, AirPods Max are superior.

Hi sir, awesome review I just bought them. I have a question regarding the NC off option. Apparently it draws more sound in using the mics, is this as intended? It's louder than with them off, you cannot use them with that option off.

    ↳ @mikelisteral7863  👍0  2021-04-20
    your saying if we turn the noise cancelling off then it deliberately brings more outside sound in? 
i heard noise cancelling reduces the quality of the music a bit. so that means we would want to turn it off if there is no sound bothering us. unless it automatically dims itslef down when there is no outisde sound. if so then we could just leave it on

    @ClydeBarber I use Youtube App for creators I want to support, like MKBHD, Dave2D, LewLater, Linus, etc. But ,I'm going to block all ads, when I want to listen to something without being interrupted like 10 time for Ads that you can't even skip when you're in the shower or away from the phone. Unless YT fixes its shit, gets short 4-5 sec Ads that ski automatically,  I prefer my peace of mind with Adblockers that I would rather pay.

    ↳ @theJesai  👍0  2020-08-13
    @ravitejaknts I buy merch from my favourite creators, like the Gamer's Nexus Anti Static Mat and the LTT Water Bottle. Like Linus said, a small merch purchase will controller more than a lifetime of you watching ads!

I don't see the need to give YouTube some share of the money, and it's not just that, Vanced has a ton more features I can't live without!

I do see your point though, not everyone who uses Vanced supports creators in their own way :/

The right hand pass through. Is that a feature of the app or a feature of the headset? I ask as these would mainly be used on my PC. But I'd make adjustments to it  through the app though? Do all app settings save to the headset itself? User replaceable battery?

I am dissapointed that YOU of all people did not mention the difference in codex support.  I bought XM3 because of aptX HD, which Sony of all people did not include in XM4. Yes I would like multi device support and BT5.0, but aptX was more important even with LDAC... as my Android phone supports it.

I know that I'm maybe late to comment but I got the same Sonys as you and I love them! The only problem is that the audio on my Mac do not function probably :/ The audio stops for like 1 seconds or less but then it skips the audio forward but not the video so audio do not longer follow the video. I exchange them to an another headphones but I do really miss the Sony! How did you fix the problem?

I very nearly bought a set of the new Beats Solo3 Wireless (with the W1 chip) to replace my 3 year old half working original Solo3 Wireless before I saw this video. Thank you. Seriously. These things are amazing, and unless the new Solo3's have improved drastically (in terms of sound) from the original set I have, I definitely made the right choice here. So much more comfortable, actually stick out from my head less (I used to hate over-ear headphones because they usually look way too big on my head, but the Beats actually stick out more), sound amazing, and ANC isn't something I knew I needed until I had it. They even look somehow both cool and understated at the same time. 

About the only way I could see that the Beats would be better is they have about 30% more battery life (apparently). But 30 hours is more than enough.

Ok, little story time. Saturday I went yardsaling as I normally do. However, I found little to no luck finding anything cool and soon went to goodwill to look around, wondering if anything could possibly be waiting in there as a secret treasure. Nothing, nothing stood out to me and I was about to leave. However, I went to go look into a glass case and spotted a familiar brand...Sennheiser. it was a case, which made me extremely hopeful as it was marked as 4 dollars. When I opened the case, a pair of perfectly good MXC 350s were staring me right in the face. Needless to say I left tickled.

To the product manager: Sony please listen carefully, I just purchased the WH-1000XM6 headphone, the extender adjustment feels cheap and isn't intuitive or smooth when adjusting. I don't know why you're going backwards, the noise canceling has been reduced it's weaker than the predecessors. Sound quality is excellent and the EQ overall is excellent but you need to work on the extender adjustment and the noise canceling. And it is not comfortable to wear at all it puts way too much pressure on my head. In my opinion the WH-1000XM2/3/4 had the best adjustment method and the absolute best noise canceling system especially the XM4's, maybe it has to do with the on-ear versus the over ear cups. Also, was the most comfortable to wear and to personalize in terms of adjustment and comfort. From one Sr. Product Director to another, this is the best decision Sony can make. Unfortunately I'm returning the headphones back to Best Buy. Sony is a phenomenal brand and I don't want the word "cheap" or  "backwards" to be associated with the brand. I have so much respect for the brand. That's why I reached out.
