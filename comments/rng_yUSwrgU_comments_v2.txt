Original: Honestly, MKBHD’s coverage on the iphone 17 lineup was a let down and im a long time watcher. They were a little late and not worth the wait. Each 11 minute video didn’t provide me with any new insights than other tech reviews. Dont take my word i think its reflected in the view counts. As soon as he mentioned d brand sales to justify pro max’s popularity my alarm kicked in. Last year he shot himself in the foot with his own app, still a supporter but more cautious now.

Original: Idk man! Once I got to experience a telephoto lens and all its glory, it kind of feels like a necessity nowadays. For any situation where you’d wanna capture something in good quality from far away–like live events or nature. I’m happier when I can capture something almost as accurately as I see it irl. Ugh. I feel so privileged saying this💀

Original: Ngl, I swore off Apple after leaving my SE gen 2 for a Pixel 8, but screen problems have pushed me to need an upgrade sooner than I wanted.  The better features of the iPhone 17 have me seriously considering it over the Pixel 10, which isn't something I thought I'd say even a few months ago.  Kudos to Apple for delivering an extremely solid product on this one!

    ↳  @Sesbian-Lex-Gamer  👍0  2025-10-02
    Original: I would necessarily say hypnotize . TLDR : Some need high perf , some dont

Are you seriously going to read entire comment ? ( save your time or don't - choose )

There's a reason people like high end phone . I would always choose the high end ones for performance. But your right " most " people use that much of what a phone can do. 
I would compare phones to cars.  Some buy iphones for luxury , like cars. It's like buying a super car because it is about luxury . However there are some , who like me , care more about performance. There's lots of cars that are expensive but some Tuners and Muscle cars are cheaper and yet fast. If I wanna drive 300KM/h , I want to choose a safe and budget supercar ( basically still expensive but it's like slightly less expensive ) . Same with Iphones altho if one is not into iphones they can buy gaming phones like red magic 10 pro + . Gaming phones are actually good for everything but gaming ( Because you don't want to play mobile games , atleast that's my opinion ). So even if you do or not , gaming phones have a lot of headroom to use for powerful task and emulation.

It's the same feel sometimes I feel when people buy iphones but not use it to fullest or celebraties buying super cars but keeping them stored. Most super cars don't even go 150Km/h. And I know it's not my business but since topic is this I said. Ofc when I said 300Km/h I meant race tracks , legal and safe.
I always wanted to buy R34 Nissan for speed , I thought it's like a budget flagship phone kind of car version. Honestly if it reaches even 280Km/h is fine. Speed is also not always fun , so I get people buying best of best. Even for iphone's defense is it actually is important for some to buy a flagship. Some people don't have PC , and maybe not even laptop or if then also a Powerful phone is very helpful at certain times.
If you buy cheap phones , it's not good when you are in need. Powerful phone means you can do many things a pc can do anywhere , despite doing it in a limited screen and lack of keyboard. If I type this comment in phone I would have passed away from auto correct and patience. I get it but ,I think one way to look at powerful phones is they can come in handy. I use gaming laptop for my work. Sure it's like using a fast car for basic groceries , but it also means I can use power tasks anytime I want without having to get another pc . Same with that car , who can speed up at emergencies.

As someone who has a A10 for main phone  ( 2/32  + Exynos 7884B ) and even a Redmi 14c recently ( I love collecting if I can afford ) , the A10 is fine for most task but due to lags Redmi 14c is better , despte of 720p LCD it's not easy to pixel peep from a bit distance , and from this I can say what you mean is right. Not everyone needs a powerful phone. But if I play games it lags hard. That's where my One plus comes .
Same with my pc vs laptop , both are same specs for basic tasks . One doesn't have a gpu (pc )  
I made sure my pc boots almost as fast if not faster than my laptop. So basically I can boot my pc or laptop and it still turns on same , leaving my pc for home tasks and office tasks on laptop. But if I want to do power task it's possible only on laptop. but this is my lifestyle and it won't suit everyone.

So It's either them to get a midrange phones , or even flagship ( older ) Android or This iphone. 
I recommend this iphone just for 120hz. You don't need it maybe , but at this price point you deserve it ( atleast if you like apple )
For me I always lean to gaming phones or some chinese phones to collect. Even I don't play much games on android , but it is important to have a mid range chip just in case.
Personally as a Spec lover , I can't deny I'm on the other spectrum of this
I'm the guy who keeps asking for more performance ( 24GB ram Lpddr5x + UFS 1TB 4.1 [ 1TB is the limit I think ])
I mean I would buy a tricked out 32TB Laptop if I could afford. Currently the only way to do this is by selling my home , so no.

    Original: I have the 12 mini and its 64 gb size is fine. I’m willing to go to 128 gb but 256 is grossly too big therefore rule out the 17.
So, do I:
A] get a 16 base (128)
B] get a 15 base (128) refurb for $300 less
C] just keep the 12 mini?🤷‍♂️

    Original: I'm still on a S21FE and honestly, I've had no issues. Battery still lasts all day, its not slow, screen looks fine. People are absolutely convinced that they need the selling points of new phones. Cameras are a big one. Yes, when you watch videos showing things side by side, you generally gravitate towards one. But you wont see competitors pictures side by side when you actually use it and you'll realize, your pictures are fine. Not to mention even in blind tests, rarely is does someone consistently pick the same phone for every photo. Every phone excels at something and does worse somewhere else. 

I went to the store recently to look at the new Iphone, I was considering switching, but when I had one in my hand I realized, its just a phone. It scrolls the same as any other phone, calls, texts, streams YouTube and browses content just like any other phone. Thought the same when I was looking at Androids and just reminded me that I dont need an expensive phone and am happy getting mid range/cheaper phones. OR buying last gen used phones (considering an S24U honestly, flagship yes, but cheap)

    Original: Suppose your iphone pro has 10 pro features but 1 one of them is a deal breaker to not have. Sure, you are only using 10% of its capabilities, but you can't diminish a decision because of it. Imagine if we were like that towards marriages! You would say, are you crazy?? Your wife is perfect, don't break up with her, she cheated last night, she has 9 perfect and reasonable features to not break up with her! That's why we call them deal breakers. A phone without 120 hz technology? A deal breaker for me! A phone that doesn't have any of the features of the current generation? Maybe a deal breaker!

    Original: @KevenCossio "MOST PEOPLE" do not need 120Hz and can't even tell the difference between regular and 120Hz display. Everybody was happy with their phone without 120Hz before it was released commercially. For me, I won;t pay exorbitant prices just to get 1 feature. Apple sales and marketing folks love EXACTLY the kind of people like you.

    Original: ​@yorha2b278 I do notice the difference. Most people who uses 120 hz will tell you that 60 hz feel slow. People who plays games on their phone, who like to scroll a lot will definitely notice. This is basically what makes a phone responsive.

The price is indeed "exorbitant", you can easily get an android for $200 which includes most basic features and that's completely fine for people who are in a budget. 

You have to understand what is the market for this phone. This is a phone you want to get for your mom that gets frustrated because her phone is lagging when she wants to open an app, the phone that you get for your grandmother so that she doesn't have to relearn every OS that there is. This is not for the ones looking for the best deal, if you want the highest value for your money get a Xiaomi. If you want the most advanced and creative solutions get a Samsung. There's a market for everyone. It just happens to be that the most comfortable phone for most people is from Apple. 

Don't judge others because your dont fit into their market.

Original: I think having a screen I can look at in summer without dimming should not be considered „pro“!

The problem is that all the other IPhones dim the screen when they get hot. They do so pretty annoyingly, like more than 50%!

And no, they don’t only do that while  shooting video or gaming? It happens literally so often! 

I.e. when charging, when watching youtube videos, when watching any kind of other videos, when esiting photos, when using maps for directions (in the car) - really bad!, when using it in summer for literally anything that uses the screen!

So tell me what we need 3000nits or make it 2000? I dont care if I can’t use that when I actually need it - outside! It just dims! To what, 500 nits?

So NO, the PRO is not only for PROs it is for people who actually want to have a bright screen when they need it!

So it is the actual biggest deal in the PRO phones to actually for the first time be able to use the bright screen consistently!

Please inform people about that, instead of saying it is for PROs only!

Original: I didn’t really have much reason to upgrade to the 17 until I saw the 256 gb, 120hz display, and the new selfie camera. I would understand the 17 pro having those features, but the fact it went to the base as well completely sold me on it. I’m sure there’s probably those that switched/bought the 17 for those reasons as well. Definitely a good phone to upgrade to if someone has been looking for the next great base iPhone.

    Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.61)

    ↳ ➖ @AbandonedRaven  👍2  2025-10-02
    Original: @epicmisulica I wouldn’t use the word dumb; it depends on if you actually use the pro features. For instance, I do like the 17 Pro has the ability to shoot raw so I can color grade pictures/videos myself, but I’d rather just get a good camera at that point than use my phone (I know that doesn’t apply to all but that’s me personally). Aside from that, I wouldn’t use many of the pro features at all, especially since the base 17 has the camera button and action button. I feel like that’s a hard call when it’s the 16 pro vs 17; versus if it was just the base 16.

Edit: Also how good is the upgrade? Like if it’s free/makes the monthly bill go down then fine. Or if the pro is so expensive that you can trade it for equal value/pay it off instantly then that’s good too, I suppose. But still do research on comparison videos and so on. I’m just a guy online who barely uses his phone to the full lol.

    ↳ ➖ @loganmedia1142  👍0  2025-10-16
    Original: @AbandonedRaven That's my opinion too on proper cameras versus phones.  For the price difference between the base and Pro I could get another lens which would actually be a better investment, because that lens will continue working long after the phone is no longer supported.

    ↳ ➖ @loganmedia1142  👍0  2025-10-16

Too bad they got rid of the plus this year when they decided to make the non pro more appealing. I bet they would have sold a lot more of them if it had this years feature set. Though it would have cannabalized the pro max and they seem to always avoid making that decision on all their product lines.

Original: I really like the base 17, its great and really makes it harder to justify the extra money for the pro, so I would be perfectly good and happy with it……except that I’ve got an older Pro phone so I NEEEEEED the telephoto lens. Once you use that, there is no coming back. Every other feature like ProMotion and such, I’ve proven to myself that I can live without (not that I want to), but not telephoto. If telephoto ever makes its way to the base model its game over for the pro in my eyes given my particular use case

Original: To be fair, I think the upgrade from 17 to 17 pro is far bigger than 17 pro to 17 pro max. 

If I were to cancel my pro order, I'd essentially get another downgrade in terms of battery, I would miss one of the cameras, no vapor chamber and go from 12 ram to 8 ram. Aside from design, which is more of the same, it is a pretty major downgrade if you ask me.

Vs pro max which is bigger screen (which also comes with the added discomfort from holding and putting it on your pocket) and a better battery... A hundred euros saved for a somewhat better battery and the added bonus of comfort, sign me up.

But to be fair, I am a very heavy user and I like my photography and photoshop, I like watching YouTube videos for hours when commuting, I like to do some video editing on my phone, I like videocall, I like the occasion game and it has to be on max settings, I like multitasking, I like keeping quite a couple tabs open for when I need it, et cetera.

    Original: Screen size. Those who are used to the larger display will not but the base iPhone. I think that’s the reason they shelved the iPhone 17 Plus. Just imagine. The iPhone 17 plus would have been the most perfect iPhone for those who wanted pro max considering all these upgrades. So completely shelved it and added Air which is not only expensive but also has less battery, less cameras and from the looks of it throttled and less performance than even iPhone 17. So if someone wanted a larger screen than iPhone 17 they have to go Pro Max because that’s the only one making sense. There is just no more any iPhone for the plus users except pro max. That’s straight messed up.

Original: The Air taught me that Pro phones aren't even for Pros. 

Conversations around the Air are often "the camera sucks, the speaker sucks, the battery is bad." As if 'professional' people are watching movies on their phones or filming movies on them. I can't imagine wanting to watch a movie on a phone instead of a TV with quality speakers. The Pro phone is the real compromise phone. It's the phone you get if you can't use a TV, if you can't listen to your music on good speakers. It's the phone you use if you can't charge your phone daily. 

I love that the new Apple lineup is really forcing people to think about their lifestyle choices. And what they really need out of a phone. I used to always get the Pro because I needed Always on Display. Now I can get that in the Air, and I'm happy about it.

Was getting a bit tired of Samsung and not wanting to pay over £1K for the ultra models that have the biggest upgrade. Battery life is great, cameras have a much more natural and true to life look to them compared to Samsung. I've been a heavy iPad Pro user for a few years, using it for digital art so being able to easily transfer and access my Procreate files is a another reason why I decided to make the switch.

Cameras are almost exactly the same (I looked into sensor sizes etc.) and the screen hasn‘t improved that much either. iPhone 17 is simply the better phone this time having a better screen, battery life, ultrawide and front camera. The only reason to consider S25 over iPhone 17 is the price, as in most countries it’s considerably cheaper than even iPhone 16.

    ↳ ➖ @ravencl  👍30  2025-10-01
    Original: apple does have retail stores but the majority of people dont buy their phones from them, because you typically get cheaper deals and trade-ins so most people just go to their preferred cell carrier store, or the one their phones have been associated with for years, and buy the newest phone there. Apple stores are also kind of rare if you arent in the big city, like id have to drive 4 hours to go to one, but theres a carrier 15 minutes away.

    ↳ ➖ @WildTorterraArchives  👍1  2025-10-01
    Original: It's just for the bit and give a TL;DR about what he's going to talk about in the review. It wouldn't work for him to say "Apple Store" because realistically, Apple wants to try to sell you the most expensive thing they have (the 17 Pro Max, for example) or whatever the new shiniest product is (i.e. the 16e as opposed to a refurbished 15 Pro which costed around the same, but generally better). The idea with the skit is to just be brutally honest to the customer about what they should or shouldn't buy regardless of whether it would hurt the business irl.

    Original: Because it’s cheaper to get a phone and a plan in the same time from a carrier instead of buying the phone with full price then choosing a pre pay/monthly/sim only plan without contract.
Let’s say you pay 1000$ for a phone at apple store then you pay 25$ monthly for your plan. For 2 years that’s a total of 1600$. 
If you buy your phone with a fixed 2 year contract from a carrier that’s will look something like 250$ initial cost and 50$ monthly. For 2 years this will be 1450$ total so 150$ cheaper. Just an example.

Original: I'll be going from an 8S to a 17 this week. This might be like the time I finally switched from a flip phone to an iPhone 4. Ok, maybe not that drastic of a change, but I'm LONG overdue for a new phone. Kind of going to miss my home button and thumbprint sign-in, but I guess I'll adapt. 😂

    Original: ​@joelface I still find nothing beats a real camera.  It simply is not worth spending nearly 40% more just to get a few extra photography features, all of which are handled better by an actual camera.  In fact if I really wanted to spend that money I'd be better off putting it towards another lens or even a newer camera body.  Both will easily outlast a phone.

Aside from that the lens I use most often for outdoor photography is wide angle, so the based model already has that covered.

PLUS I'm nervous about breaking it the whole time... haha. With my phone...

If I sidegrade to a 17 from my Air, it’ll only be because I actually might need the 6.3”, and the extra .2” of the Air may have made it just a little too difficult to reach all over than is comfortable

I am wanting to upgrade for numerous reasons; 16 plus overheats easily, it’s been having issues with lag & glitching (can’t handle iOS 26 well would be my assumption), wanting pro motion & a better selfie camera, and wanting to downsize for better one hand use.

    Original: Does it not feel small tho? I got the base 13 and regretted it ever since bc i thought it was small so now im not sure whether to get the pro max or the base again cuz i would be spending 1700 AED (463 USD) extra just for a bigger screen and a few extra hrs of battery life. Like im tryna justify it by saying it will last longer bc of the vapor cooling chamber so the battery stays healthy for longer but its starting to feel delusional to me.

    Original: Hm I switched from 13 pro and I was bit underwhelmed by the “improvement” I wanted something lighter and didn’t need any pro camera stuff so I got 17 but only thing I see noticeable is battery (old one was at 75%) and I thought it would be super dramatic improvement but it just gives me an extra hour or so. Maybe AOD along with other stuff is consuming more battery. I’m not gonna return it purely because of the hassle but this does get me to think that be I could have used my 13 pro couple more years by just swapping the battery

I’ve always had the Pro model of everything, so it feels like a no brainer to get the 17 PM, but I’ll probably stop by a retailer just to get a feel for the 17 base as well. Go try it!

I also want to thank you for not using an iPhone Pro in the video, which is what many iPhone videos tend to do, even when the video is about the base model of iPhones!  I have often wondered if podcasters receive a kickback for focusing on the higher-priced phones!.

As you clearly said, Pro mode phones are not what the average user (80% or more of phone purchasers) needs!

No matter how much better that phone actually is, the higher price tag alone is enough reason for them to get it. Especially since the iphone pro models look so different now than the regular iphone, they'll want that distinctive "high end" look.

For most people the extra features the pro models have are just there for them to justify getting the more expensive phone.

The only issue I have the last month's, is about update on a few not important applications that stopped working ( Zara, H&M) and I can use them. So because of that and because I should move to a new generation phone with all this new fitures, I am considering to go for iPhone 17 256gb or 17Pro256. The only reason I am thinking the pro model has to do with the ram 12 instead of 8ram for iPhone 17 and the telescopic camera. As a user that changes phone only when it is not working anymore I think this future about 12 ram especially, is important for the future. What do you think?? 🤔

Original: Asterisks!  Lack of telephoto zoom is the only thing holding me off from buying the 17-non-pro.  I loathe the design aesthetic of the 17 Pro, and the ridiculous aluminum hump - it's a design nightmare.  Aluminum looks like a Mag-lite, but at least you cover it up with the silicon case not he 17 non-Pro.  But I must have zoom.  I take a telephoto photo once per week at least.  Telephoto zoom camera is not a "Pro" thing.  It's used by consumers on vacation to take photos of sea life or birds, or architecture/scenery, all the time.  2/3rds of Apple's phones cannot zoom.  Insanity.

    Original: The avg consumer doesn't need any of these features, though.

One of the features you mentioned, "PWM dimming", is the default for nearly every OLED screen on the market -- this isn't a noteworthy feature. What the iPhone 17 introduces is the ability to disable PWM and switch to direct-voltage control over dimming. So you didn't even understand what the tech was and yet touted it as something Apple "really nailed"?

My Pixel has 256GB, 48 MP ultrawide, 120Hz, always-on screen, PWM dimming, 3,300 nits, scratch resisitant display, thinner borders, 6.3" OLED, and a 48 MP selfie camera. This is what most top-tier phone specs are in 2025. Apple is just playing keep-up.

I never intended to rock my iPhone 8 for so many years but after 2 years it was still perfectly fine so I had no reason to upgrade but maybe 2 years ago I started noticing that the battery was really starting to fade but I had no money and was in between jobs so a new phone just wasn't going to happen and then this year I've noticed that several apps have been notifying me that they will no longer support either my phone or the version of iOS on my phone so I knew I needed to get a new phone. I honestly wasn't even planning on getting the 17 as I just wanted something newer than the phone that I had but when I went on my provider's website it became very obvious that the iPhone 17 was the best deal to be had and I ended up buying it while remembering very little about it so now I'm circling back to this video to refresh my memory.

So with the whole ScratchGate thing going on and with the IPhone 17 Pros now being all aluminum, do you think if we get any scratches on our phones, and with people that get their phones wet and mostly leaving them in the bathroom while they shower, do you think these phones are going to rust overtime due to moisture?

Original: Display pulse smoothing.... I gather this is about an intentional type of screen flickering that can make the screen look dimmer and use less battery (?) but that some people find bothers their eyes. Turning it off means an alternate method of screen dimming is used. BUT, I'm curious why this is the default method used... I'm guessing it's better as long as it doesn't bother your eyes, so most people should just leave it alone unless they're having eye fatigue. Anyone have strong opinions about that?

It’s still early, but over the years I’ve had a 5s, 8 plus, and a 12, and this is the biggest jump I can recall. It’s still “just” an iPhone, but it does feel a lot more premium. From the matte finish to the UX. Cheers.

On the iPhone 17, I do like the centre stage on selfie mode. I do not like the iPhone 17 pro design. 

What do I do? Wait for iPhone 18 in hopes that they might add Telephoto, ProRes and better design to the model or just get iPhone 17 in hopes that with software updates I might get ProRes and Telephoto?

While I likely won’t use many of the Pro features regularly, it’s the 8GB to 12GB difference in RAM that’s got me stuck. Is investing the extra money in the extra RAM worth it and will it help my phone last better for the 5 years i plan on using it?

Original: 13 Pro Max users READ THIS

I used the iphone 17 for around 24 hours and the phone is good phone do not get me wrong however coming from a 13 pro max these are the things i will say:

Size: coming from the 13 pro max the size of the of the iphone 17 is noticeable but not that different. I will say if you have been using a smaller phone since forever then by all means this iphone is the best ever for you hands down. If you are a Pro Max user like myself you will definitely get jealous of a 17 Pro Max user once you hold their phone in your hand (this is from experience please trust me). 

Weight: I can tell you for a fact it was such a shock to hold this phone i will not lie to you it is so light compared to a 13 pro max like unimaginable and so unreal its crazy that a phone so light could be so powerful. Having felt the weight of the iphone 17 max as a 13 pro max user i will say it is much more comfortable to use and is lighter to use which is insane. The way i hold my iphone 13 pro max is i have my pinky at the bottom the phone, the finger close to my pinky and middle finger stretched at the edge and then the finger close to my thumb centered around the middle and then i use my thumb to type and its so much easier to do this on 17 pro max

Battery: I have not used an iphone 17 pro max to test battery however from the people i know who has the 17 pro max they say the battery is the best ever and coming from a Pro Max line up i feel you will get extra confidence knowing that your phone is now set for the future in the long run and the upgrade will feel more worth it. Like i said i am speaking to 13 pro max users however the battery on the 17 was just as impressive i will say.

Display: This is bright as hell dude like when i compared it to my 13 pro max it was absolutely noticeable and i love it. When i compared to how snappy it felt from 13 pro max you can tell the difference so i can’t even imagine how nice it is on the 17 pro max. If you are a small phone user you will not be disappointed with the display.

Speakers: This little guy is really really loud i couldn’t begin to tell you how shocked i was when this thing played music it was sick deffo an upgrade.

Dynamic Island: Coming from a 13 pro max we don’t get this luxury and for a few extra bucks i would say its worth having compared to what we get on the 13 pro max. 

Camera control & Action Button: i personally like these new features so getting this on either phone is just a plus dude especially coming from a phone that doesn’t have them.

Selfie Camera and Camera: Wow lets just say game changer from 13 pro max its astounding definitely an upgrade which either one you go for

Future Planning: i feel like the 12gb gives me a safer or confidence booster that if i don’t upgrade in the next year or 2 years that the phone will be equipped for any future software upgrade or AI upgrades so thats something u will need to take into consideration however if you are a casual user it won’t matter.


All in all if you are 13 Pro Max user please do not make the mistake of going for the base 17. Yes you get a ton of upgrades but you will miss that screen and i feel like you just get added bonuses which is a bigger screen, better battery with a brand chip to help with performance, comfort and much better cameras which is why i am returning it.

SMALL PHONE USERS - Best ever phone you can get a hold of right now.

    Original: ⁠@yyuyutsu I’ll be honest both cameras are really great on either phone and telephoto was not something used in my day to day so i think its preference. It was cool to see the base 17 all the capabilities of the 13 pro max without the telephoto so either way you go you still win

If you were seeing a pro max like i said really just get the 17 pro max honestly.

Original: The prob w 17 is the colors.
they are ALL color or black/white, no metallics other than the pro silver.
This is a problem when  you want a clear case and no black/white, and don't want bad color choices.

For example,
The iphone 13 and 12's blue look so good, the 'dull' without being 'matte-pastel'.
The iphone 15 pro's metallics tan and graphite, look amazing.
The 13 pro colors are so good it's not even funny.  None of these colors are around its all "high pop pastel" like "annoyingly colorful". 
When you have a black desk and a willed-black bmw with black interior, you cannot ever find your phone if black.
Then, white is white, it looks "okayish" at best, never great.   For guys, white is always a "would be better in a metallic or cool color".

So both the 16 and 17 have trash colors, and "shades" of the colors (like pastel), that's the problem.
Carriers don't like to stock old phones so 15-pro you have to order in just to get the metallic.  Holiday deals usually exclude old phones, like the 15-pro. 
Would rather have a 16 or 17 in iphone 13 blue, even 12 blue was amazing.  Or any of the good metallics of the pro's.
ALL of the iphone 16/17 colors look not so great after 1 hour  let alone 20 min outside of the store that has vertical lights making them appear nice in person.

Also, 120hz doesn't go well with battery life, at all, and we are trusting for the dynamic to lower the display rate to save battery.
120hz is far less valuable than battery life, same with AI vs battery life, and max screen brightness vs battery life.
FWIW the speakers on all these phones are the worst audio-devices on the planet earth, but that's an impossible feat in such a small size that doesn't plug into your ear.
Having an in-phone DAC would probably maybe help this for plugging in wired which is > wireless as wireless is "another thing to charge" and wired goes under your shirt.

Original: I would buy the Pro just for the improved thermals, both my iPhone 14 and Xr get insanely hot just using them regularly. Also they get stuck during charging, especially in hot summer days, because the battery temperature is too high. Every time I buy a 'non pro' model they tell me that since 'it is the less powerful chip, then the battery lasts longer and it won't get as hot' - not true.  This is an issue I never had with my old iPhone 6s plus, which still works and I use around the house for emulation gaming, quick searches or youtube videos.

Original: The iPhone 17 is a no-brainier phone to upgrade to this coming year. Apart from the USB C port, I genuinely think that this is the phone to get for most people 🎉 I just hope apple continues to pay attention to the base lineup like this, even if those updates come in late — comments in all videos show that ppl have held on to their older phones bcs no one is willing to lay $1k for phones, or upgrade to the latest model on a yearly basis.

Original: I just got the iPhone 17 today and I’ve been rocking my 12 pro max for the last 5 years thinking to myself that I needed to upgrade to the 17 pro max, but after doing some research and comparisons, there’s only slight differences between the two models on the iPhone 17 lineup, so like a rational person would, I went for the base iPhone 17 and I couldn’t be more pleased with what I’m getting in terms of performance, usability and the look and feel of the base 17 from Apple. Overall it’s an awesome phone for the price you’re paying, you’re pretty much getting a pro version of the iPhone 17 without actually paying the extra $300, which to me is a great deal from Apple. 🍎😎

    Original: Exactly I've been saying this for the longest time as well technology has gotten no point where it's not about the flash anymore it's about just the major quality improvements that we keep getting year over a year and I really hope more people will start realizing this and ultimately that all these improvements that people think are no big deal are what continually make the experience better and better all the time. And as a result hopefully people will start appreciating technology more instead of always complaining that it doesn't have this or that thing. Very well said comment!

I had that pro phone for 4 years and never once shot pro res/raw video or used the LiDAR Scanner. Plus th colors on the pros are atrocious and it was goofy not to include black or at least a midnight color. Saved myself $400.

Original: Hi there, 
I've been watching your Channel for years & really enjoy your videos. 
Watching so many videos, sometimes I feel the need for some features but those features come very late. 
The next feature I wish all mobiles should have is very interesting. 
Actually, I'm from Pakistan but living in Spain. Last time I lost my phone here in Spain & I was so upset. I was thinking how can I find my phone back but I wasn't even sure when & where I lost it. I was thinking all day long & searching for my phone but couldn't find a way to find it. It was quite bad & I felt helpless. 
Then an idea  came in to my mind, what if smartphone companies add a little hardware like "Samsung & Apple" tag. Inside the phones & it helps people find their lost phones . This little hardware can solve a very big problem for smartphone users. The  tag inside a smartphone can be connected only to the battery of the phone & even when the phone is off the tag must be getting power from the phone battery & the one who loses his phone can connect to the tag from another device & find his phone. 
I hope what I think of. There must be a good chance to do it easily on a commercial phone.

Original: I'll be hanging on to my S10+ for one more year. I wasn't too keen on buying the iPhone 17 series with Apple's first in-house modem. Hopefully it works well for folks, but I find that it's best to wait for the 2nd year product after a redesign. With Samsung trying to be the new Apple, I really don't see any reason to buy their phones anymore. Especially when most apps for pilots are on Apple's suite of software.

We are still talking about a 1k phone in most markets and in times when even mid-tier phones are fast enough it is….just a phone. I was at the store, compared it to my old 14 which I ditched last year in favour of an S24 and….yeah it was a phone, but it didn‘t feel like a good deal. For 500….maybe I‘d return. But for 1K I want the Pro and even at that price tag I would not be sure I‘d buy it

Original: I just went from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to an iPhone 17 base, and the only “complaint” I have is screen size. I lost a little bit of screen size, but for my stubby fingers, it’s actually become a blessing in disguise. The little bit small size means I can do more, on my phone, with only one hand. I have significant carpal tunnel in both hand, and reaching with my dominant thumb was starting to becoming painful from over stretching. With the slightly smaller screen, i don’t have to stretch as much. When I first went to look at upgrading, I wrote down a list of important things that I need vs. want, and the base iPhone 17 met all those features. If I want a bigger screen, I can mirror to my TV or get out my iPad. If I need more advanced photo editing, I can easily switch to my Mac Mini. I didn’t need all the bells and whistles that I needed when I chose the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I’m a few days into this new phone, and I haven’t found a feature on the base model that I miss that was exclusive to the Pro models. Maybe my 14 Pro Max was outdated enough to make me think that the 17 is amazing, but so far, I got a phone at half the price and I’m missing nothing!

Iphone 16 128gb was $905 here and the base iphone 17 256gb gonna be priced at $1040 which is about the same price with iphone 16 256gb. Same thing happening to the pro and pro max.

Basically price wise its like the 128gb model never exist now and it jumps to the pricing of the last year 256gb lol. It kinda sucks here.

Original: I do believe that it's probably a cycle where iPhone will launch amazing base level iPhones with small niche leaps on the Pros and other times will be basic base level with giant leaps on the Pros. That way, it helps them to stretch out improvements across the board slower/longer (and potentially more stable or better compared to others in the market).

It also helps that iPhone probably has strong buyer segments for the Pros every year no matter how good or less good it is compared to the base iPhones.

Original: Theres 2 main reasons people buy the Pro/Pro Max and personally I think it's intentionally structured this way by apple which is smart. 

1. How many cameras are on the back is seen as kind of a status to some people, they think people will perceive them higher by seeing their iPhone having 3 cameras instead of 2 cause they will know it's the premium model 

2. If people like big phones and want an iPhone,  the Pro Max is the only really big iPhone

And the setting in accessibility did help for PWM. So for all the people’s who still hesitate they should change now by the way I was a very bad case of PWM.

Original: i think it’s good to note that the base iphone 15 did see the biggest upgrade in a base iphones camera showing Apple was capable of including better hardware in a base model and then the 16 was essentially a copy paste 15 with slight better internals and then they double backed on the base 17. undeniably the best base iphone when you compare it to the rest of it’s line up its released with. it’s the first base iphone to be closest to the pro models. apple in my opinion is starting to walk in a good direction with this.

However, I am a little disappointed that you didn't bring up the 16 pro in this review as an alternative instead of the 17. They have the same screen, the 17 is just a little bit brighter. The 16 pro has a telephoto but not the new selfie camera. They are very similar and I expected you to bring it up in this review. Do you think that it is worth to get the 17 over the 16 pro?

Original: I completely agree with this review. The only thing I'd quibble with is that the telephoto camera is really great and is the reason the Pro line is still compelling to me. I'm NOT a "pro" but I do enjoy zooming in for my photos -- I can't be the only one?
If they could include a telephoto (maybe with a worse sensor, like how the main sensor isn't quite the same between the base and the Pro), it'd be perfect.

I don’t miss the 2X camera, and even though the battery is smaller, it’s only a *little* worse than my Max, which was a pleasant surprise. The upgrade to the ProMotion display to the base model is what pushed me to upgrade. 

Really really good value and I’ll be sticking with this one for a while.

Original: My wife and I had a talk last year about what new phones to get. She was due for an upgrade and we couldn’t see why we would get pro phones anymore. Yes you get the extra camera, and everything that comes with a pro, but we never use any of those extras. She got the 16 last Christmas as her 12 pro was having technical issues from new updates. I just upgraded from my 13 pro to the 17 and I couldn’t be happier. Some of the stuff that seems like you can only get in a pro IPhone, I get with the base 17. I do wish they kept the Plus models instead of the flip that is the IPhone Air, but going to the 17 from a 13, I still get a bigger screen in all aspects, the cameras are newer, the refresh rate is way better, and the volume is much better. It has been less than 24 hours of getting the new phone, but already I am very happy with the base 17.
