The 120hz RR and the 256GB base is really a deal breaker.

Is this better than iphone 16 plus? In my country, their prices are the same for the 256gb model.

    If you're interested in good battery life, the iPhone 16 Plus is a better choice.

Not gonna lie they put in work in this one.

iPhone got its name back

    ↳ @tacticalsanti5438  👍14  2025-10-07
    They just stopped nerfing the base model and made the price reasonable. Other than the selfie camera and the reasonable price, I don't think it's anything special

    ↳ @usmantariq7997  👍0  2025-10-08
    ​@tacticalsanti5438You say "made the price reasonable" like its no big deal. For people who cannot afford those $1000 phone but still want an iPhone with proper experience, it is pretty special.

    ↳ @admiralrng6506  👍1  2025-10-08
    ​yeah but man what a gooood upgrade, I'd be feeling ripped off if I bought the base 16 by now

    ↳ @loose4bet  👍0  2025-10-09
    @tacticalsanti5438 CPU and especially GPU upgrade is substantial. 256 base storage is huge. Better screen. It's one the best base models released ever.

With all of the upgrades, this was the year I upgraded to the iPhone 17. Which says a lot because I’ve mostly been an android person.

    ↳ @TreyGarlic-mr7ut  👍1  2025-10-08
    What andriod you had before this? I have a samsung a52 and after 4.5 years i want to upgrade and im consdiering getting the iphone 17

    ↳ @5150crazyfun  👍3  2025-10-08
    @TreyGarlic-mr7utI had the 9a and the Moto G Stylus 2025. Both are good but the iPhone 17 is better in my opinion. Oh and years ago I had the a52, you’ll love the iPhone 17 if you get one. Definitely a huge upgrade.

    ↳ @katinasoutherland7693  👍0  2025-10-08
    ​@5150crazyfunI love and use both IOS & Android. The Pixel 9a is one of my favorite phones yet the 17 base is pretty dann amazing!

I don't think Apple will ever make a good phone. I've never liked any that they have ever made. My Motorola edge 30 ultra is head and shoulders above anything they made. I've had mine 2 years in November and it's PERFECT

256GB base storage, 48MP ultrawide cam,  18MP new front cam, 120hz refresh rate, new chip. Definitely worth an upgrade

    ↳ @tacticalsanti5438  👍17  2025-10-07
    Unless you already had a pro, I totally agree.

    ↳ @brahney1439  👍0  2025-10-07
    ​​​​​@tetzet3254nothing phone 3 and Xiaomi 15t pro are also USB 2.0 .
And priced same as iphone 17.
And they have ltps screen not ltpo as iphone.
And midrange screen protection gorilla glass 7i 
Whereas the iphone has much better protection with ceramic shield.
And battery life and camera are better on iphone even if it lacks a telephoto.
This is the best value for money iphone ever.
Especially compared to android.
The first time an iphone is priced better than android premium smartphones.

    ↳ @dubnation619  👍5  2025-10-08
    And only 8 gigs of ram

    ↳ @sandihermana4873  👍9  2025-10-08

    ↳ @jaytech1962  👍7  2025-10-08
    I can completely understand why you’re saying that, I was on the 14 Pro Max, and I decided to switch to the 17… I’ve had it now for a few days and I have to say, the thing feels like a complete upgrade! Plus it being a bit smaller, and very much lighter, I enjoy that very much… thing feels like a powerhouse, USB-C, my iPhone 14 Pro Max didn’t even have that. As a matter of fact, the 17 has a better screen than the 14 Pro Max. The 17 is a beast.

    ↳ @Fluskar  👍1  2025-10-08
    @solver55 Apple still has way longer support for their phones than 99% of android brands do and has better resale value on the used market

Adding an anti-reflective display even on the base model is such a punch in Samsung’s face, as they only offer it on their Ultra variant. Now I’m hopeful that Samsung will feel ashamed and include it across the entire S26 lineup, including the FE

[39] @BartBuzz  👍4  2025-10-09
My 10 reasons for upgrading to the base 17. There should be 11 if you count the $799 price tag.
1. ProMotion
2. Always On display
3. 48MP Ultra Wide Rear and 18 MP Front cameras
4. Faster processing chip
5. Enhanced performance to support Apple AI
6. Double the storage (256GB) at the same price
7. Longer life battery
8. Bigger display
9. Tougher front and back via Ceramic Shield
10. Action Button

    ↳ @notmedude  👍16  2025-10-07
    @romella_karmeyyou are completely wrong. Base 17 gets you so many features of the pro except for one lense and a few codecs. It also weighs less, looks better (come on - sage green is superb to any pro 17) and it doesn't scratch as easily. It's the best base iphone since 13 mini.

[64] @hsimpson1152  👍5  2025-10-08
I find it hilarious how everyone is praising the 17. This would have been a great phone in 2023. It only seems better because Apple controls the narrative on it's products so well. Yes, it's the best base iPhone ever but that's in a class of 1. The only real standout is the selfie camera.
1- lousy usb file transfer speeds
2- iOS 26 still seems to be in beta
3- photo processing tends to an orange tint
It's still a good phone, but let's not go nuts with praise.

    ↳ @jaws10278  👍2  2025-10-08
    Who is using USB to transfer files on a regular iPhone?

    ↳ @Fluskar  👍2  2025-10-08
    The USB C 2.0 transfer speeds are wack I agree, but how often are you realistically transferring enough data for that to matter? Most phone users are casual users and transfer through USB probably once a year or barely ever. And pros would just switch to the Pro models anyways.

Nice to see an iPhone that's actually worth the money for once

    ↳ @janslop  👍0  2026-02-07
    its way too expensive for what its offering.
You can get the the Oneplus 15 with better speakers, 165hz refresh rate, 120 watt charging, 7300 battery, Qualcom elite gen 5 chip for even cheaper price.

    ​@janslop I'm not saying that I'd buy one myself, I've used android since 2013, I'm just saying that for iOS it's quite a decent package

    ​@parshakamarshyeah thats kind of true. What do you use?

Choosing between OP15 and Oppo Find X 9 pro

    ↳ @parshakamarsh  👍0  2026-02-07
    ​@janslop personally I'd pay the extra and go for the Oppo, but you can't go wrong with either really. The OnePlus is more focused on performance and gaming, the Oppo for photography which is what I'm more interested in. I think you'd enjoy either

    ↳ @janslop  👍0  2026-02-07
    ​@parshakamarsh
yeah indeed.
I hear in reviews that the design of the OP15 is little bit better compared to Oppo. Thats its little bit lighter and better in the hand

    ↳ @parshakamarsh  👍0  2026-02-07
    ​@janslop its great value for money, go for it. I'm holding on for the upcoming Find X9 Ultra, I've been reading some really good things about it 👍🏼

This is the first time that I would recommend an iPhone base model as it has got some upgrades, but the Pro models has been my favourite since the 14 Pro. The problem here is iOS 26, it has a lot of bugs and it's chaotic. Apple has launched some updates.
And as always, iOS is not for everyone.

Hi @GSMARENA Team,

I am confused between iphone 17 and galaxy S24 ultra  to buy,

I am a singer and want to start youtube career via recording videos natively on mobile.

I've heard that for videography iphone 17 is better than s24 ultra. Is this true.??

Kindly make a dedicated comparison between iphone 17 vs s24 ultra complete camera comparison and user experience as that's going to be the purchase decision of many folks out
 there.

I am a fan of your work. Thanks

13 Pro Max users READ THIS

I used the iphone 17 for around 24 hours and the phone is good phone do not get me wrong however coming from a 13 pro max these are the things i will say:

Size: coming from the 13 pro max the size of the of the iphone 17 is noticeable but not that different. I will say if you have been using a smaller phone since forever then by all means this iphone is the best ever for you hands down. If you are a Pro Max user like myself you will definitely get jealous of a 17 Pro Max user once you hold their phone in your hand (this is from experience please trust me). 

Weight: I can tell you for a fact it was such a shock to hold this phone i will not lie to you it is so light compared to a 13 pro max like unimaginable and so unreal its crazy that a phone so light could be so powerful. Having felt the weight of the iphone 17 max as a 13 pro max user i will say it is much more comfortable to use and is lighter to use which is insane. The way i hold my iphone 13 pro max is i have my pinky at the bottom the phone, the finger close to my pinky and middle finger stretched at the edge and then the finger close to my thumb centered around the middle and then i use my thumb to type and its so much easier to do this on 17 pro max

Battery: I have not used an iphone 17 pro max to test battery however from the people i know who has the 17 pro max they say the battery is the best ever and coming from a Pro Max line up i feel you will get extra confidence knowing that your phone is now set for the future in the long run and the upgrade will feel more worth it. Like i said i am speaking to 13 pro max users however the battery on the 17 was just as impressive i will say.

Display: This is bright as hell dude like when i compared it to my 13 pro max it was absolutely noticeable and i love it. When i compared to how snappy it felt from 13 pro max you can tell the difference so i can’t even imagine how nice it is on the 17 pro max. If you are a small phone user you will not be disappointed with the display.

Speakers: This little guy is really really loud i couldn’t begin to tell you how shocked i was when this thing played music it was sick deffo an upgrade.

Dynamic Island: Coming from a 13 pro max we don’t get this luxury and for a few extra bucks i would say its worth having compared to what we get on the 13 pro max. 

Camera control & Action Button: i personally like these new features so getting this on either phone is just a plus dude especially coming from a phone that doesn’t have them.

Selfie Camera and Camera: Wow lets just say game changer from 13 pro max its astounding definitely an upgrade which either one you go for

Future Planning: i feel like the 12gb gives me a safer or confidence booster that if i don’t upgrade in the next year or 2 years that the phone will be equipped for any future software upgrade or AI upgrades so thats something u will need to take into consideration however if you are a casual user it won’t matter.


All in all if you are 13 Pro Max user please do not make of going for the base 17. Yes you get a ton of upgrades but you will miss that screen and i feel like just get added bonuses for the screen which is why i am returning it

SMALL PHONE USERS - Best ever phone you can get a hold of right now.

I just upgraded from a 15 to a 17. First i  didn’t think there was much difference. But there really is! It’s just plain better.. I am a musician and record a lot of jams. It’s the first time I have used it to record out playing and I am very happy about the recording quality and the play back on the phones speakers.. it’s very good .. much clearer and more detail. Plus that extra memory shows me to hold soo many more recordings.. I got very disillusioned with some on ios18 but I have to say I am glad I took my friend’s advice and stayed with Apple.. I hate the Mac.. don’t get me started… but the phone and ios26 I really like . Very happy
