[7] ❌ @musicofnote1  👍3  2025-08-19
Original: As a retired Apple Supporter/SysAdmin, I bought a 15" M2 Air. for the price and (most importantly) what I do, it would have been wasted money for a Pro. 6 weeks ago, i did buy a use 16" 2019 Intel Pro - base model - which I bought mostly as a box for a sundowned music notation program I still need - It cost me all of $350. Last night on a lark, I used it watching ripped DVDs- Nice screen, nice speakers, not appreciably better than the M2 Air. But its real strength is as an office heater in the winter. HEAT!! So now in August, it's not really comfortable. The M2 however is at 45 degrees. No problems, even in the summer.
Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.46)

    Original: What would you advise a junior devops engineer to go with?. I am currently using an intel macbook pro 2020. Would an upgraded macbook air with m4 chip suffice for virtualisation, docker etc or I should rather go for a 24GB RAM 512GB M4 pro chip macbook?.

    Original: ​​​@cptsi-z5s I would much prefer a windows laptop. But this video is not about that. It's about Macbooks. My thought process was I'm willing to pay for the extra performance, I do not care about form as much (lightweight, thin, etc). Especially since the Pros get great battery life which battery life and portability is literally the main purpose/selling point of a MacBook. Windows on ARM has not caught up yet. If you want a  great fast laptop that has extremely good battery life and screens you get a MacBook. If you want way better performance but not as good battery life you get a Windows laptop. The Windows side has not caught up to the same performance and battery life ratio that MacBooks have because, let's face it, Windows on ARM is not all the way there yet. Hopefully in the next few years there's more competition.

Original: I currently have and still use my MacBook Pro (mid 2014 model) so it’s a good 11 years old. I want to upgrade but not sure if I need the pro or if the air will do just fine. I want it to last 11 years like my current MacBook. I edit raw files in Lightroom and photoshop from photo shoots, I open multi web browsers at once, check emails, and create charts in google sheets and that’s about it and I usually have my screen brightness up as much as it allows for because my eyes are not the best. I do edit an occasional video here and there but nothing extreme. 😅 which do you prefer?

Original: the biggest thing is the fan. apple tries to make a design without fans. the result is no sustained performance. it works as well as an iPhone or iPad would do, it’s just running macos. now why on earth would you get a macos device that can’t even perform sustained loads? isn’t that the point you get a mac because the software is more powerful than iOS? yeah i don’t get apples logic here. no one should buy the macbook air. go buy an iPad with M series chip or a Macbook Pro. there’s no in between.

[70] ❌ @my_monk  👍0  2026-02-09
Original: I use a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4, and my wife uses a 13-inch MacBook Air with M4. From my experience, it is simply not comfortable to work long hours on any laptop screen without an external display. The posture is bad by default. You sit hunched, head and shoulders tilted down, and that takes a toll quickly.

Once you add a proper external display, the advantage of the MacBook Pro screen mostly disappears. At that point, the built-in display becomes secondary, so paying extra for a Pro just for the screen makes little sense.

Performance-wise, the M4 MacBook Air easily handles every realistic task I can think of. For the vast majority of users, it is more than powerful enough.

That is why the 13-inch Air is the sweet spot. It is extremely portable, noticeably more affordable, and very versatile for work-life balance. You can work all day connected to an external display, work on the go when needed, or just lie on the sofa and relax. It does all of that without compromise.

Don’t get the base chip MacBook Pro. It’s not worth it. I say M4 MBA >>>> M5 MBP.

When MBP was M4 or when MBA is eventually M5, all the more reason to get MBA when base chip is concerned.

Original: Hey everyone.
My 2019 Macbook Pro 13" 128go intel just died past month, and I have to buy a new Mac for the new year in university for the beginning of september.

Knowing my utilisation and my last Macbook Pro, my priorities are to upgrade of course the RAM if possible to 512go cause 256go seams a bit thick knowing I have just totally filled my 128go, and also get a screen bigger cause 13" was a bit too small.

Knowing that, my first thought was to buy a Macbook Air M4 15" with 512go. But I have seen that the Macbook Pro M4  14" 512go is just 150/200€ of more, so I wonder if it’s not better to put 150€ more to have the better screen, the connectors (micro SD, HDMI etc (I am gonna use it a lot)), the better battery, and others things like the better sono, the cooler so more power for long asks, etc…

My only fear is that I have seen them in store and the difference between the 14" and the 13" is not that big, so I clearly would buy the 16" but it can’t come with M4, and it’s clearly not reasonable to buy the 16" M4 pro for my utilisation cause the price up for 1700€ to 2600 (NB it’s in € cause I am french and I have the students price, that’s why it’s a bit less expensive than the normal).

So to resume, I am hesitating between :
- buy a Macbook Pro M4 14" 512go (1700€)
- or be more reasonable and buy a Macbook Air M4 15" with 256go and I buy an external SSD with 1to for exemple (cause it’s make me a bit mad to buy an Air for 1500€ when the Pro is just 200€ more)…

Do you have some advice or feedbacks for me about this two computers ?

    ↳ ❌ @SOSULLI  👍2  2025-09-05
    Original: I'm guessing you confused a few things. That RAM doesn't exist and you mean gb right?

The thing mainly is, how apple scams people, the macbook air is so cheap, but everyone gets tempted to at least go from 8 to 16gb RAM. Also definitely a 512GB SSD. Then you're at the price of a pro obviously. 
And with a base Pro you're not really tempted to upgrade RAM to lets say 64GB, useless.
Or get a 2TB SSD etc. 
So I would say, look at the screens, which do you prefer. Then either go for a definitely good for money Air with basic specs, but don't get tempted to upgrade a few things. And with the macbook pro, definitely don't go above $2000,-
The people that choose macbook pro's for 2500-3500 never ask anyone the question which laptop to choose as they know what they require for their heavy graphical work.

    Original: ⁠​⁠​⁠@SOSULLIyes I said RAM cause it’s about the same thing.
and the « RAM » is automatically at 16go minimum on the Macbook Air M4.

and in the end I choose the Air M4 15" with 512go in clear blue, and I really like it, so glad I choose it. and the gap between my 2019 Pro 13" 8go/128go i5 and this is juste amazing.

    Original: @raphael4783 Not sure what you mean. You referred to RAM as being "512go". 

I'm guessing you mean SSD and gb instead of go.

SSD is your hard-drive and RAM is your working memory. So one can get up to 4TB and the other is often 8-64GB.

    Original: @SOSULLIno I was reffering to SSD saying 512go.
It’s juste that I wrote « go » instead of « gb », that’s it. 
And I write RAM cause it’s easier than « unified memory ».

But, and this is a huge but, the apple silicon chips, the m series, are INSANELY good and a massive game changer. Just got the m4 macbook pro and im absolutely blown away how good it is. Absolutely nothing in this price range comes close to it. And before the neckbeards come out, yes gaming laptops beat it in gaming but why the hell would you get a macbook if youre gaming? Although I will say it can play some games.

Original: My office laptop is mac book pro . My personal laptop is mac book air . 1)Which is superior ? , it is mac book pro. 2) is mac book air worth for 1000€ for it’s competitors?, it is 100% worth buy 3) is mac book pro worth than MacBook air?, yes pro is worth than air , if you are ready to pay 1800€.4) what should i buy then?, i don’t mind the money difference, i need the best buy for one time spend, just go for pro. Pro has superior sound speakers and powerful than air.5) why i bought MacBook Air as my personal laptop? Because 1000€ is my max budget, i need a light weight to carry,i compared mac book air with other brands not with pro.MacBook Air is definitely superior that any any brand of this price range . Hope my feedback is useful ❤
