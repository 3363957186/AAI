Original: OK so I’ve had mine about roughly 3 weeks now and I actually love it! The 256 gig is a game changer. There’s a whole lot of features that wasn’t there before. It’s a bit sharper now and the screens are smoother to move in between and I haven’t even touched the level of dynamics of the things that can do. I like them outside light feature, which you can program that button to do anything you wanted to do. Unfortunately, if you’re used to using the other iPhone, you’re gonna hit that a lot before you get used to it. So it’s now three buttons as opposed to two.

Original: Guys I'm in a dilemma. I'm looking for a new phone (upgrading from a Samsung A14). I'm looking at the base iPhone 17 and the S25 Ultra, both at the same price in my country. I would prefer a smaller phone since I've got small hands and I believe it would be more comfortable, but at the same time, if I get the iPhone, i feel like I would be missing a lot of deal-breaking features. Can anyone help me out?

Original: I have a few questions. I’m considering the iPhone 17 Pro Max because I prefer a large screen — coming from Samsung, big displays are something I really like. You’ve been recommending the smaller iPhone 17, but I want to know if the Pro Max will still fit what I need.

A couple of specific things I’m wondering about:
	1.	Does it still support magnetic charging (the MagSafe style on the back)?
	2.	Will my current USB-C charger work, or do I need to upgrade it because of changes in the new phone?

Thanks!

    Original: @ShaneSymondsYes, I agree. Other than the Dynamic Island on the 15, the base models haven’t really changed much since the 11. With the 120htz display and the camera control on the 17, it’s definitely a good time to upgrade for most people and at a respectable price point.

Original: 5:08 Bruhhhhhh! Seriously? Comparing iPhone 17 action button with a built-in samsung flashlight button that nobody even heard of? Even S21FE variants turn on flash when screen is on or off with double click if you set it up with lock button. You can even set up another action for triple click. My S24Ultra turns on and off flash with triple ans turns on and off silent mode with double click with lock button. Lame
