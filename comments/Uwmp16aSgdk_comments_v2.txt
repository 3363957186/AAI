Original: I have a mid 2021 Macbook Pro. My next Macbook will probably be the Air. I don't need a pro. I only got the one I have now, because of the 4 USB-C charging ports (2 on each side). It's real convenient when it comes to charging. Other than that, I would be fine with the Macbook Air.

[12] ➖ @thomasnewsom6084  👍4  2025-03-13
Original: Bravo! Finally someone said what I have been saying for a long time. For me at a certain level it's not about the processors as the M3 and M4 can handle most anything.But why oh why can't I have a better screen on the Air even if I have to pay extra as an option??? Also my pet peeve as a storage developer for a lot of years is why can't they just leave the 3rd Thunderbolt port in the Air. Sometimes it's just about connectivity and not just ripping performance. I'm also not wanting the extra port to connect yet more displays for crying out loud. 
I appreciate the great videos you have done over the years and hope you continue providing a calm voice in an environment that can become a bit screechy at times.

    ↳ ➖ @TamasKiss-yk4st  👍3  2025-03-11
    Original: @benlau2045 that is only true for Windows machines.. the 8GB memory Macbook still completed the most demanding benchmarks without any Windows weakness: "sorry you need more RAM to use this application".. so when the 8GB Laptop still outperform the 16GB Windows Laptops, than you should separate the two things.. yes it's help a lot if you have more RAM, but it still continue to run the program without error messages, and at the end of the day only that is count, would it able to do what you wanted or not, because of not enough memory errors or blue deaths... (sure the benchmarks are important, but how often you will use your car at maximum performance? How often bothers you if the dashboard is only counted to 240km/h and not to 360km/h..? If the "smaller" max capacity is still able to do the work properly, who cares, the other car have a different dashboard with different max speed limit..?)

    ↳ ❌ @heroninja1125  👍5  2025-03-11
    Original: @TamasKiss-yk4st Thats full of cope, 16 is better then 8 no matter how much you try to twist it. MacOS will just eat up memory swap which lowers the performance and lifespan of the device, but judging on how you have written this comment, you probably replace your macbook every 3 years like a good little consumer. 

Theres nothing wrong about enjoying a cute little two cylinder prius that carries your groceries, but some of us want minivans or trucks because we have work to get done and need to get things from place to place. We don't use our devices as a dedicated netflix watching device like you do.

That's why I gave up, moved the Mac to the living room, and bought a new Windows box for the home office. I just couldn't get work done efficiently on it. Plus, macOS does weird things when trying to use home/end/pg up/pg down in a document. My cursor doesn't move, but everything on the screen does ... and there is no native clipboard history. After you spend a few years using that daily for productivity it is a HUGE leap backwards. Amazing hardware. Full props to Apple for that, but their software design decisions make it frustrating AF to use for actual work. At least for me, living in a Microsoft environment.

For a MacBook pro, I agree the minimum should be 512 or 1tb but for a student, I rarely fill my 256 unless it's filled with a bunch of videos from a couple projects. My desktop has 12tb but for my work laptop, I don't need anything storage intensive and if you do, you'd probably need more performance like if you're editing videos you wouldn't have an air in the first place. ​@Flattithefish

    Original: @Allys96 Really appreciate your points. Well full disclosure my first Job was with Apple and I left in 2011.. 
I have seen Apple make plastic crap; and plastic tanks; the unibody CNC Aluminium design we have today was chosen primarily due to the heat dissipation properties.
Sadly, that was never used like it was supposed to. See, around this price point, whatever PCs are available are more computers. Don’t get me wrong, but in absolute truth an ARM SOC design was never meant for a full stack computer. That’s why IO ports are an issue.. 

These are great with battery and almost anything.. but when you really throw actual software on it (not apps, Application Stacks) the ARM architecture begins to struggle..
But 95% users have nothing to gain or loose there.. just that during the Power PC days the IBM chips used to be more capable than x86.. this direction is reverse. So that’s my perspective.. buy what will be useful for you, that’s good for all.

Am I dumb or are you gullable.. is not a debate.
That is the price one should get this hardware for. But you can pay more so they will sell it for more. Eventually we are promoting this hype cycle.
SOC's originally were invented and used for cheaper compute capacity.
The Apple Studio monitors or the XDR displays for what they do are actually much cheaper than other products in the professional world. A $1000 stand, is a rip off. That's what I am saying.

It's mostly just marketing nonsense to get you to believe you're paying all this extra money because you're getting a far better product and it's mostly hype. They're pitting us against each other to make us think we have a better product than the other guy. Here's the thing: Nobody actually cares which computer or phone you own or which car you drive.

    Original: @suhulfx No, the dumb thing is you pay top dollar because you fall for the hype. That's exactly what the marketing gurus want you to believe, and you fall for it. We all do. That's why these companies are so successful. eventually, after so many years you get pissed off at forking out another $1000 or so on the next great iteration of the product and eventually you realise you just bought the exact same thing as you bought last time with about $5 worth of tweaks. 

My daughter buys Apple, I prefer Windows and the touchscreen is a big thing for me, but I've done the same with Surface devices and eventually you realise you can pull out a 5 year old one and it still works in exactly the same way, at virtually the same speed as your shiny new one. You're slightly in the crap with Apple because you can't buy a different brand if you want to stick with their OS but 99.9% of us don't need much more power or speed than you can get with a $400 computer. They're having us over and we're all falling for it, but don't worry, you do work it out eventually. Remember, nobody cares which computer you use, which phone you buy or which car you drive. The only thing that's affected is your bank balance and your ego.

But it's OK to spend what you want or need, just don't fall for the upgrade con every couple of years. You do stop falling for the hype and figure it out at some point, when you get fed up of spending another £1000 every time the marketing guys tell you that you need an upgrade.

    Original: @ChrisPollard Exactly. I've been buying Surface devices for years and they're equally as good but without the limitations of Apple. I wouldn't know what to do now without a touchscreen so that's the kicker for me, it would be like going back in time and all the Surface devices I've had have been fantastic and reliable. 

The biggest problem we all have is we fall for the marketing hype which is designed to get us thinking one is better than the other, that you are buying the best ever. After a few years "upgrading" then realising your shiny new laptop isn't much faster, sharper or better constructed than the last few you bought. Is your new laptop really any better than the same model you bought 5 years ago and the other three inbetween?  The penny drops and you stop buying pointless upgrades just so you can have the latest kit, and guys, nobody else cares what phone, laptop, car, or anything else you have.

    Original: First, I wouldn't recommend a high-end laptop for real work to anyone.  

Next, we need to see if using a different OS is even an option for someone or this won't go anywhere. If you trapped with MacOS and MacOS programs, then it doesn't matter if the replacement is $50 or $5000, you don't really have any non-Apple choice.  When there isn't any competition for other reasons, acting like raw performance matters is a waste of time.


If you earn a living with very specific software and hardware, nothing else will work. Stick with it.

OTOH, if a laptop is for typical home uses - browsing, social networking, very light video editing and watching, then there's little need for even a $300 laptop.

For example, 
Ebay has a Dell Latitude 5420 - Laptop 14" Core i7-1185G7 3.0GHz 16GB RAM 512GB SSD that would be overkill for almost everyone's needs for $205.    Prettier versions for a little more.  Scratched versions for a bit less.  Free shipping.  Highly rated seller.  For $180, the 10th gen version is also available.  There's an ebay $10 off coupon today.
I cringe when people spend the same amount on 8th gen or older CPUs.  Friends don't let friends buy old junk.  For laptops, I'm an Intel-guy.  
My "new to me" laptop is a Core i5-11th gen that looked new. Lite, fast, great battery, beautiful screen.  
For desktops, I buy whatever is the best value for the need.  Sometimes that's a $35 Raspberry Pi and sometimes that's CPU/MB/RAM components for $350 to triple the performance/capability  compared to what I have.  I re-use old cases, old PSUs, old speakers, provided each works like new still.  My 5.1 speakers are over 20 yrs old now. Cases are 25 yrs old.  Think the last PSU I bought was in 2008.  My desktop is rated just under 20,000 passmarks. It replaced a powerful MB/CPU rated around 6000 passmarks that used 2x the power.  The cost of the new system was paid for by lower electric bills in less than 3 yrs of running. Add in my "increased happiness" and it was a huge win.


Many home users would be very happy with a Chromebook if their entire computing use revolves around websites and google junk.  A supported ChromeOS device is probably the single, most secure, computing device available today. I'm serious.  Of course, security and privacy are very different. Don't use Google stuff if you care at all about privacy. Same for all social networks that aren't federated and use strong encryption - cough Matrix.

    Original: @Flattithefish And? It's good enough for a lot of people, and if not for you get an upgrade, a network drive, or external SSD. It's half the starting price of a really comparable windows laptop like a X1 Carbon. That sure comes with 512gb as standard for the base config, I would hope so considering the base config is $1800.

    Original: This is exactly why I came here. I'm starting school in 10 days and going into a media program, and the bookstore on campus gave me a $1000 credit for financial aid. After buying books, I still have a decent chunk left over, and this laptop was listed on their website for $899, so I was highly considering picking one up to last me the next four years. After seeing this review, I think I'll do just that.

I used to be a Windows fanboy talking shit about Mac, but eventually I got a Mac cos I heard they were meant to be good for music production. I swear for a year or two, I actually just used Windows on it (via Bootcamp). 

Windows got messed up somehow, and rather than fixing it, I just started using Mac OS instead, and after getting used to it, the whole experience just feels so  much better.

If you had an M1 air 8gb, and you find yourself running into issues then upgrade, I bought that in uni and have some issues in blender on larger scenes, and they issue really seems to just be ram related

Original: Bought a base level M1 Air in 2020. It's a dream machine for my humble needs. I do light photo and video editing on it in addition to the standard document writing and web browsing. It's just amazingly lightweight and fast, with great battery life and software stability. I'm afraid I've been turnt and will be sticking with Apple laptops from now on.

I suspect in like four years I’ll buy this M4 MacBook for like $700 when the M1 finally kicks it but these M chip MacBooks are phenomenal.

Original: My 2015 MacBook Pro (16gb ram) is having a hard time with all my internet tabs plus other apps that it forces one app or two to close. I think I spent around $2000 when I bought it new. That's $200/year or $16/month for ten years. Might be time to buy a refurbished MB with M4 and 24gb ram.

Original: I’m not trying to be a hater but I gotta be real. Do you want a better display right but for 999? What are you expecting? I meant honestly that’s why they have the upgrades if you want better you GoPro or you go max I meant they make this version of this device for the people like me that’ll never run it past 5050% of what it can do OK and me personally totally happy with my screen more than happy. No they shouldn’t have put a better screen cause the price would be so much higher if they put nano texture, it would be it wouldn’t be a MacBook Air. It would have to be a pro because it wouldn’t have the price range to be an air. I meant OK I’m 63 years old so my first computer I’m gonna tell a story I don’t care how long it take my first computer I bought from RadioShack. It cost me $3500 and it was not upgradable. I had a 33 MHz processor. I had 520 something memory. I had a 20 gig hard drive for $3000 do y’all get it today? I’m paying I pay. I just bought an M4 MacBook Air cause I dropped my M1 and I had some plugged into the USB-C port so it broke the port inside so I couldn’t get it fixed cause it was fine. I would’ve never I would’ve been another two years. OK at least cause it was fast enough. It did well. This one’s a lot faster and I’m at zero latency now where I was at five latency on the M1 so the upgrade was worth it but you guys and I listened to a lot of you guys talk. You act like you’re not getting enough for your money go back to when I bought mine first computer or my first MacBook OK it was almost 5G back then bro and we complaining about what we got my first computer it was. Bruh was nothing portable about it. It was a big back. I mean it was old. it was it was just VGA. It wasn’t even a great screen, but it was a screen. I could see I could watch videos only but it wasn’t great but now with the technology that there is today and the value you guys are getting for what you’re getting Man I remember building my first city. My first computer could write CDs then I built my first computer. I can write DVDs I remember I’m doing it yesterday. I’ve had to buy a scuzzy card that cost $200 just to be able to record a CD. I was wanting scuzzy. You understand we’re talking way back in the day bro that computer cost me every bit of $2000 and I built it myself that was after having my Aptiva by IBM for 3500 so let’s appreciate what we’re getting for the value we’re getting it for. I only paid 799 for mine and four 799 with tax came out and I didn’t get the AppleCare. I spent about 1000 bucks OK but that’s not 3500 and this is portable and this is 1 billion times faster than that 33 Magir entail I’m gay running on 386 was it 26 might’ve been 286 I don’t remember it was so long ago but I’m trying to make it. Let’s be grateful that I meant. I would’ve never imagined that I could record myself DJing video when I didn’t even never thought of recording DJ video. I’m in A DJ so I was 12 years old and on vinyl I would’ve never guessed we’re at the level of I can record my whole video session which is normally two hours long and this computer don’t even get it might get Luker. It increases 5° from idol to me recording and DJing video. Could I even think of DJing video back then with that Aptiva no I was grateful to be able to play a video OK but you guys about I wish it needs a better screen this computer. Don’t need shit. Leave it the way it is for 799. This was a steel steel cause the previous computer I bought a refurbished for 849. I didn’t even get an extended Care on that one. This one I did just because I dropped the last one I’m older I don’t wanna drop it and I lose it this way I can replace it for less money than me repaying the whole amount. It might cost me 120 130 bucks to replace the computer if I drop it and they have to replace it when I’m trying to make it stop doing that please let’s be grateful for what technology is available today I even saw flying cars in Africa. China brought a bunch of flying cars to Africa. I would’ve never thought I’d be live long enough to see a flying car that someone can buy for $400,000 out of reach but the point is it’s available to someone if they wanted it bad enough wow let’s enjoy what we have and be grateful that God provide us with all this great technology cause Boy knows this computer is 70% faster than my old computer. You know that going from the M1 just to forward it’s 70% faster just to know that and I pay less for it and it’s a better computer cause you got center stage 10 P camera speaker sound really good on this one too I mean, I love my old speaker, but this one has a little bit more low in on it. They gave me MagSafe, which freed up my USB ports. I only had one back in the day because basically once to stay for power and you use one in the hub now I got both my ports, I can go to external screens plus my screen if I ever needed to couldn’t do that in one, so I’m grateful y’all need to be grateful for the technology that we did didn’t have that I didn’t have to come up with or you that someone else built for us to be able to have and use so let’s be grateful thank God

Original: I'm a software engineer with a MacBook Pro for work. I grew up as an Apple hater. I'm going back to school this year for my masters degree and decided I needed a laptop that isn't owned by my company and decided to get this macbook air. Usually I go for a higher skew item because I like powerful computers.

However the value and portability of the air from this generation just seems too good to pass up. Although I like the mbp I don't really want to carry around two of them in my backpack all day. 

I'm hoping this device works for me!

    Original: ​@Renovatio2142 Not everyone can cough up thousands if not hundreds of dollars to daddy Apple each year, just to have the latest stuff. Apple builds their tech to last, and I'd say the M1 MBA has half it's life still left ahead. 
If anything, it's you who are irresponsible, buying tech every year causes environmental degradation, and you're contributing to it that by not using tech for it's intended lifespan, and are just adding to the already difficult to dispose e-waste, let alone the pollution involved in manufacturing and shipping. 
You're no one to call someone poor, especially when you're the one in the wrong. Besides that, the M1 MBA is still a very capable computer and still overkill for casual day to day usage, for most of the use cases out there. 
You should buy something, only if you actually need it, especially tech. Tech is a commodity, just like food is, you should buy as and when you need it. Buy new stuff only when the old stuff doesn't serve your purpose anymore. You don't buy tech to show it off to others.

Original: The M4 Air is basically a “Pro” laptop already. The truth reviewers rarely say out loud: this machine is powerful enough for ~96–97% of people who think they need the M4 Pro. The Pro is only meaningfully better for a tiny niche of users doing multi-hour 4K/8K exports, heavy 3D/VFX, or ML training. For everyone else, real-world performance is identical. Apple’s product ladder only survives because reviewers keep repeating the “Air = casual, Pro = serious” story. In reality, the Air is the best MacBook for almost everyone.

Apple’s laptop segmentation strategy is to artificially differentiate insanely similar machines so customers voluntarily climb the price ladder; not because they need to, but because the tiers are engineered to feel meaningful.

    Original: @brandon-22 It's not just the contrast but also brightness. Apple is able to push SDR at 1000 nits with the M4 MacBook Pros (you can find many apps that can do that with the previous Mini LED MacBook Pros as well) and trust me that makes a huge difference. And yes, the option for nano texture is absolute game changer especially for MacBook Air users who aren't in the market for a more accurate display but rather a more legible one because people use them outdoors alot

    Original: This ….
They should also do the same for the iPad Air as well. The iPad Air now has a 13inch display. Now that the iPad Pro isn’t using mini led again, it would be great for the iPad Air to now come with the mini led display. And pls God, Apple should make it a 120hz display. It now impossible to justify 60hz in 2025. At least upgrade the iPad Pro to 160 or 200hz so that the Air can now come with 120. 
Apple basically charge you more for less.

Original: keyword here is "cheaper" you don't often see companies making products cheaper. usually they only get more and more expensive and they will always find a way to justify doing so. The base Macbook Pro in 2020 was 1499 Euro now it is 1929. The base Macbook Air was 1199 Euro in 2020, 1299 in 2024 and now it is back to 1199.

    Original: true. but to be fair, the macbook pro now is very different from the previous geneation pro. The display for example is in a different league. In fact, the old macbook pro is more comparable to the macbook air now. So the pro has gotten much cheaper. On top of all of this, 1499 euros in 2020 is equal to around 1841 euros today. this is also ignoring increased energy costs in europe (heating the shop floors, powering all demo devices,  transportation and deliveries). this also ignores the decreasing disposable income of european customers, resulting in less purchases. 1199 euros today is equal to around 978 euros in 2020. So its actually gotten 221 euros cheaper (while the costs are much higher). The price has been made lower to increase profits, since the price of living in europe is higher now (less demand for premium products).

    Original: To be fair, the 13 inch MacBook Pro was just a MacBook Air with a boxy shape, hence the cheaper price, people doing *actual* demanding work would NEVER buy a 13 inch pro because it simply wasn't fit for most demanding workloads, it was severely underpowered and overpriced, the proper pro computer (if you could even call it that) apple sold at the time was the 16 inch, the 13 inch shared its name and build, but they were very different machines overall, but now? both MBPs are the same, the only real difference is screen size. So it's more like they're now selling a smaller version of the 16inch pro.

Original: About laptops getting boring, and not much changing:  That's great.  I would love to see more of that.  Refresh the hardware every couple years, with a little better this and that.  It's a mature product.  It doesn't need to be reinvented.  The need to be "exciting" just means the feature you care about most is always potentially on the chopping block to make the new model "fresh."  I would much rather that this year's model is just a slightly better version of the previous one.  I don't need it to be exciting, I just need it to work.

    Original: @  I still find myself frustrated by software lifecycles.  Granted, I consider a 5-year-old laptop to be "gently used" and assume that it will still have some years left in it.

But I am literally running into this exact problem right now.  My general purpose computer is a 2018 Mac Mini.  Work is BYOD these days, so I keep that on my hand-me-down 2014 Mac Mini.  I have no desire to upgrade either -- they do the job just fine.  .... Except I can no longer update software on the 2014, because newer apps require a current (which these days, means "this year or last year" release) of Mac OS.  And Mac OS 13+ doesn't run on a 2014 Mac Mini.

It could.  But it doesn't.  Because .. ehh.. you've had it for 10 years.  It's time to deposit another coin if you want to keep playing.

The hardware's fine.  Apple just decided not to include drivers for it anymore, and blacklist it from the installer.  And of course they tune the dev software to require the most recent OSes and that's IT.

I know I'm in the minority here, but that should not be okay.

I would also suggest getting a Rain Design stand, a NuPhy Air75 V3 keyboard and a separate Dell U2725QE monitor with 4K hub. The M4 will display two monitors but you need a Thunderbolt dock (like the one on the Dell U2725QE) to do it. M1 and M2 will only display 1 monitor.

I could be wrong though because it sounds more visual based. One thing I do know is the most important thing when it comes to data analytics is make sure you have at least 16GB of Memory. A lot of the work I do is moderately to big size data sets from IPUMS CPS, some private companies, FRED, etc. And all the data I import from there (which is a lot) has never caused my laptop to overheat or run slow. What kind of work do you with Matlab? I've always wanted work with it, but it's never been a priority to me. Do you recommend it for anything?

Original: I'm on a beefed out M2 MacBook Pro and I'm still impressed with how amazing ARM technology is. My laptop is so good, the only way I see it ever leaving me is if I outlast the final wave of software support for it, cause it isn't even dipping in speed after a few years like Mac Laptops have been known to do. Like my 2011 MacBook Pro became extremely slow and hence getting my 2016 version. The hardware on the 2016 was fine enough (a little slow, but it could handle 20-30 audio tracks in Logic Pro X), but I had so many battery cycles with this thing, that it only works plugged into the wall. The only hardware from Apple I am interested in is a Mac Studio, because it feels like Apple has FINALLY released a good desktop experience that gets rid of my need for an upgraded laptop. 

Apple hardware has gotten so good, that now people are upgrading not because they need to, but because they want to. That just wasn't the case years back when 2-4 cores was the standard, where there was a good reason to need a better processor and more RAM. Like I love Windows and Linux and x86 hardware, but sheesh, Apple continues to impress me with every year.

Original: Non of the youtube video I saw, clarified about usefulness in coding. As a software developer our day to day job not only including surfing on net or emailing but also running codes or simulations of ML RL models. I would really appreciate if you can tell us about that part as well. As I can see Macbook Air M2 is having hard time simulating models with 8 gigs of ram and 8 Core CPU. What better does Macbook Air M4 bring us above all, with reference to the coders out there. I also request you to include your understanding of the laptop in coding. I am not much of a video editor, so I don’t know how can I compare it with coding and what resources video editing uses that might be used in coding.

It handles it perfectly, even with both programs opened at the same time. When I bought it it exceeded my expectations by far. I hope my current one still lasts a few more years, but If Apple maintains this great-deal mentality I'll definitely buy the same laptop. Plus, I must say this new color looks gorgeous.

Original: Just to add my 2 cents.
I bought one. The base model. It is the best you can buy.
After 14 years of using MacBook Pro, my employer forced me to detour to a Windows Laptop. My goodness, what an insult. There is still basics not working. With the most insulting part being the touchpad. No, I am not the physically disabled, I am a pianist. Windows touchpad is an insult. As is the cursor. With an active cursor tip being somewhere but on the tip of the cursor graphic. Back to Apple, to the new MacBook Air, I feel caressed. Positioning a cursor is how one expects it to do. A keyboard, obviously "understanding" what key was supposed to hit. A command button on the only possible place to be anatomically best etc. etc. So, what makes the new Air even better than any Pro? Ample power without fan. Need a better display? No. The display is brilliant. Though OLED is better, and the Pro's display as well. The MacBook Air has a near very good display. Last, the on board audio is a best of its class. Such dynamic sound out of a fraction of slice of a pizzza box is just... brilliant. Adding to that is the missing fan noise. And so this MacBook is the best you can buy in means of usability of a Laptop. Simply the best mobile computer you can buy.

But let me tell you this: I am a programmer, working with very data intensive tasks where millions of data sets need to be processed in very few time, and I was never able to push my M3 MacBook Air even close to the limit! Apple Silicon is some serious shit I can tell you (its actually so good, that I have never even used my AMD Ryzen 9 workstation PC for programming tasks, I just connect the MBA to the screen).

And with Apple finally doubling the base RAM in new MacBooks, I would love to see them double the base storage considering storage prices are not that expensive anymore.

    Original: The base storage should be 512gb and the max upgradeable storage should be 4TB instead of 2TB. One of the main things swinging me away from the Macbook Air 15 inch is not having the 4TB option. 




I need the extra storage but don't need as much processing power as you get with the Macbook Pro. You could say to just store everything on external drives but honestly for video and photo work I need the working files on the computer and don't want to be offloading files constantly onto external drives.

    Original: Work just got me the base M3 Air (16GB of memory). I can say that the laptop handles it "as expected" not "pretty good" because of 16GB of ram. Especially when you're running multiple containers and you got other tools open too, it can get pretty slow. When we're pair programming, my boss asks is this really how fast your laptop is? (when cursor shows completions in under a second much faster than lsp can serve them in 1.3s or so). That's just the nature of 16GB for development sadly. My 32GB m1 max is still doing great for development though and I don't really have a reason to upgrade :)

    Original: ​​@JayJayNay Well, I'd look for benchmarks, but I think there's an improvement. Also, I recommend you check if 16GB is enough or you'll need more. For storage, external ssd should be a lot cheaper than upgrading it with Apple.
Btw, remember that MBP has hdmi, SD card port, and other things that you could use/need, like mini-led panel with really good HDR.
And the M4 added ray tracing cores, perhaps helping with advanced lighting simulation tasks, but I don't really know that much about editing programs hahah.
Also, remember that Mac Mini is great and cheaper, in case you already have a monitor and don't need a lot of portability.
Anyways, M1 is still being really good, so be sure that the improvement is worth it.

Original: I have used Dell Latitude and XPS, and Lenovo Thinkpads in the past. Last year I started using a Macbook M3 at work and was shocked at how fast and efficient it was. I use it for running often 5+ instances of VSCode, docker containers, many dozens of Chrome tabs, Slack, Spotify, 1-2 2k/4k external monitors, and it never even gets warm much less turns the fans on. I bought the Macbook Air M4 with the 512GB storage upgrade last week for personal use and I think it is the best laptop I've ever owned, and is significantly cheaper than the last XPS and the last Thinkpad I got. With these Apple chipsets and unified memory and such excellent passive cooling (or chips that don't get that hot to begin with under most workloads), Apple has so massively surpassed the PC market and Intel/AMD CPUs for the majority of users.

I have been using a macbook air m2 with 8g of ram for the past two years. It got me through the end of a mecanical engineering degree, ran parametric cad for fusion 360 and is now my full time machine for doing web and backend developpement. It is doing great! Right now it is almost always running 4gs of docker containers plus multiple tabs, even microsoft stuff wich is known to eat ram on macs. I will sometimes get to 6gs of swap without the computer slowing down. I feel like there is a real market for the macbook air, when you want something light, powerfull and that has no fans.

    Original: Exactly, it's ridiculous to phrase it as a casual machine that can 'handle' the more extreme stuff, when imo, it can do a whole lot of the 'extreme' stuff quite comfortable and is a perfectly viable machine for like 95% of workflows. If I compare it to a MacBook Pro today, for me, the value in the pro comes in the form of better battery, batter speakers and better screen rather than performance - and all three of those things are also still great on the Air.  However, I would say that if you're getting an Air (or any laptop really), you should splurge a bit on the RAM, as personally for me at least, I feel like the 8/256 config on my M2 has been a bit of a handicap. Anyways, my point was that these modern machines - esp the latest M4 gen, but even M1, have way more power than most people need for most workflows - casual and pro.

Also reviewers can get be delusional I think. They can get the most spec’d out model and upgrade every year to the latest and greatest. Of course when you then compare it to the Air which is for mortals and hobbyists it is a lot better. 

Like Marques would obviously not use the Air for his video production. But someone starting out? Why not. Airs in 2020 were revolutionized and are capable of stuff now. Prior to that yeah you'd probably have a really rough time getting away with it.

I'd go for 16/512 or 24/512 if you can afford it. but of course, if you think 256gb is enough for you then go ahead. Look at your current computer and think about what's the limiting factor here and focus on those things.

Having read lots of reviews from customers on many electronic store websites, many shared what they use their macs for and there are many who just browse or watch shows with it.
 I don't think it's a bad thing if a large chunk of users are getting a reliable device for whatever they use. It lasts and in the long run you don't have to upgrade which saves up money as an effect. I personally use it for davinci, autodesk, affinity, clippaint studio and c0rnhub. Pretty poggies ngl.

    ↳  @Ottertiles  👍0  2025-03-12
    Original: @alanbo859  It is a tough decision because our interests are different. But because I am an engineering student I can relate to you. Let's break it down:

1. Macbook M3 pro: good if you get it at 16/512. It will be heavy especially for a laptop to carry around. It has a fan that can handle a lot of phyton, js, or simulation better than a fanless laptop. It has more battery which is a big deal.

2. Macbook Air M4: my judgment is a bit biased cuz I like to move around and get my job done outside. It will serve some improvement I believe from the previous chip and give you more portability.

3. The RTX laptop has two categories now, the lightweight like Zenbook and the chunky Bigboy like ROG, Legion, and Katana. Please make sure to get the x86 manufacturer just for more compatibility for developers. Laptops with RTX Will give you more raw power in exchange for battery life. 

a. I preferably will choose the lightweight Zenbook because it can last at least close to the Macbook. It is a bit biased because I love to move around which laptop battery is a big deal for me and also its performance.

b. If you want to get raw power but it's okay with 3-4 hours of battery life and a jet engine then it's chunky. Or seriously just get a PC, I can't survive in the wild with that kinda battery and jet engine.

Conclusion: I will recommend you the MacBook Air M4. Apple silicon will eat your everyday project like a piece of cake while giving you a long battery life. It is supposed to have a ray tracing same as M3 so js or Blender will be easy. If you're into machine learning and data mining get the M3 Pro, because of the fan. Or if you live in Canada just toss your laptop outside the fan or no fan no problem 😂

I hope this will help you make the decision.

Original: A laptop is not a phone. 512GB storage should be the bare minimum on any laptop nowadays imo and a thousand dollars is not a small amount of money. Especially considering most laptop users keep their laptops for many years, that is not enough at all. And if it is enough to some people, then the majority of those people do not need an M4 chip at all imo. I think saying 256GB of storage is enough and bragging about the M4 chip are two contradicting statements because high performance needs complementary storage. I have no doubt it’s an amazing laptop. But I still think the base model is a sneaky illusion if you think about it.

For example, the Dell XPS lets you upgrade to a 1TB NVME SSD for only $125. For 16gb to 32gb RAM, it’s $130. They use the same quality and generation of soldered DDR5 and Gen 4 NVME. I do agree that it’s not a lot of money in the scheme of things, considering how long you use it for though. It’s just unfair comparatively

While the Macbook Air is a highly capable machine, I think it makes sense for most serious photographers and videographers to spend a little more and go for the Macbook Pro, specifically the mid spec one with the M4 Pro chip. The extra processing power, ports, and fans make a big difference when intensively using programs like LR, PS, and Premiere.

Hope this helps!

But I also bought a couple of Windows laptops with graphics cards at the time for cheaper, including a lenovo legion with graphics, 16gb memory and 1 tb disk drive. But the slightest use in this after the first couple of months would activate the helicoptor of a fan. The Air is not for gaming but everything else, is fine and without that loud fan!

Original: Actually, this shows how much these rich YouTubers are disconnected from the general population. There’s like so many people (like students and in entry level jobs) who can only afford an air but want to do a lot more stuff like video editing and photo editing. Specially in counties other than the US.

Plus, you buy it to use for a while. So if someone can buy this now and use it for more CPU and Graphics intensive stuff in the future too, this is a good investment than a much more expensive pro.

Original: Got the macbook air m4 13" today. As coming from a windows user, I find it hard to learn the apple iOS system, but I'm working on it. I think it takes a bit of time to figure out some stuff but that I'm fine it. Why I went with MacBook this time is because of mainly two things. 1. Lifetime of Mac laptops are usually much longer then for windows laptops 2. In this pricerange I couldn't find any windows laptop that would have this nice sleek design, aluminium case and also being fanless. 

The only downside is the display. It's okey for doing normal tasks, but I wouldn't watch movies or play games on it. 

Maybe I could have waited for next gen MacBook air to see if it would have different display and 120hz. But why I didn't wait to see is because of price and "if". The price here in Sweden for apple products have become redicilus. The only model that have a good price today is the entry level MacBook air. If u going with the 15" instead of 13" u have to pay around 367 dollar more. And also what will next gen cost, probably around 200 dollar more then the release price before dropping. 

I think this laptop will last me a long time and all in all I'm very happy for getting it. :)

I agree with you. I absolutely don't want to use a 60Hz display in 2025. It doesn't make much sense to buy a Pro for everyday use. I'm really torn between options. I wish they'd given the user a choice with a 120Hz option, but Apple can charge a pretty high price for such improvements.

Also, even if we were talking about phone processors, it isn’t so clean cut. Looks to me like the two Android phone chips you listed trounce iPhones in Antutu, but the A18 Pro smokes them both in Geekbench. The different silicon each specialize in their own ways and aren’t quite as easy to compare directly to each other.

With no disrespect intended, I'm not sure which internals you refer to. Most of the market is circa $1k, and most similarly priced PCs outstrip Apple by a considerable margin.

    Original: @chargersfan1111 Definitely an impressive CPU.  Apple knew that changing from Intel compatibility to a proprietary chip would have pros and cons.  Running a different CPU means having a different instruction set and that emulating other platforms would be a little harder.  Having much of the system in a single chip, also called an SBC - Single Board Computer - reduces manufacturing costs and locks people into their products more than using generally available CPUs does.  

A bunch of people would buy the Apple hardware, but wipe MacOS from it and run other OSes when it was Intel-based.  Apple usually makes good, long-lasting, hardware.

Original: My wife was nagging me about this Macbook Air for some time, she was annoyed by her Ipad M1 Pro, because of that stupid non centered camera when using the Ipad with a keyboard. She was using the Ipad 95% for her homeoffice work and online meetings, no 3D modelling or whatsoever that requires a high end mashine. Long story short, I've watched this video, got me convinced, we traded the old Ipad in and ordered a Macbook Air M4 last week. Done.

    Original: @Yorker1998that’s how they get you! An Apple Store employee once told me that they aim to get people to think more about their second Apple device than their first one, because then they’re locked in, with how easily everything synchronizes. 

Currently rocking an M2 Air connected to an Apple Studio Display (the monitor being my favorite Apple product I’ve purchased, unexpectedly!) & Magic Keyboard / Trackpad, along with a current gen M4 iPad Pro, as well as the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Everything works together flawlessly, and little niceties like seamlessly copying and pasting between devices (even images and files) really seals the deal for me. 

Not to mention they make trading up when new phones release incredibly easy - the Apple Store offered me 2.5X what anyone else did for my iPhone 15 Pro Max when I purchased the 16, and as upfront credit vs a carrier bill credit or similar. 

Too easy, as the title says :)

    Original: fantastic! just so you know, google synchronize just as easily all your files, pictures and movies from an android phone to virtually any device since chrome can be installed everywhere... even on a mac and an iphone

the only drawback, you cant synch an apple watch or benefit of all the tech of airpods with other brands, but lets be assured that the EU will come after Apple on these obvious anti-competition fake barriers

Original: I’ve gone full circle—Windows to Mac, Mac back to Windows. I had an amazing experience with an Asus N56VM that lasted 8 years. But after that, every Windows laptop I tried had issues and seemed obsolete after just 4 years. For example, my Vivobook S15 had its webcam fail after 10 months, the microphone followed two months later, and I couldn’t find any drivers anywhere—support was useless.

Now, five years later, it barely functions, and I’m planning to go back to Apple. Even when you find a Windows laptop with good specs, the battery life is almost always terrible after a couple of years—and it often costs more than a MacBook. It’s funny, because it used to be the other way around in terms of pricing, and it seems like Windows brands haven’t really improved over time.
