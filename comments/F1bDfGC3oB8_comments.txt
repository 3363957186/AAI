Your most recent video dissapeared! Why?

The 17 has seen the most comprehensive and significant upgrades in years and as such as definitely the one for the majority of people to get.

OK so I’ve had mine about roughly 3 weeks now and I actually love it! The 256 gig is a game changer. There’s a whole lot of features that wasn’t there before. It’s a bit sharper now and the screens are smoother to move in between and I haven’t even touched the level of dynamics of the things that can do. I like them outside light feature, which you can program that button to do anything you wanted to do. Unfortunately, if you’re used to using the other iPhone, you’re gonna hit that a lot before you get used to it. So it’s now three buttons as opposed to two.

Guys I'm in a dilemma. I'm looking for a new phone (upgrading from a Samsung A14). I'm looking at the base iPhone 17 and the S25 Ultra, both at the same price in my country. I would prefer a smaller phone since I've got small hands and I believe it would be more comfortable, but at the same time, if I get the iPhone, i feel like I would be missing a lot of deal-breaking features. Can anyone help me out?

    ↳ @chandlerdempsey8412  👍1  2026-01-11
    Definitely get the 17.

    6-8 hours SOT over 2 days is my usual battery life.

    yeah that's the iphone air

    ↳ @officialyasir  👍0  2025-12-17
    ​@CogWerkI want two speakers and cameras and a bigger battery. Just keep it around 190-195 grams, that's the sweet spot. The Galaxy S25+ proves it's possible, it's 190 grams.

    ↳ @FernandoAlvimYT  👍1  2025-12-22
    I agree 100%, I went after a 16 Plus in Paraguay in 3 stores, laughed in my face saying that nobody wants this device and they don't have it. I was 17, but if I had a 17 Plus I would definitely go on it.

    ↳ @cjayowpico  👍0  2026-01-26
    Sales were bad last time they did it so they just went ahead and made that variant the experimental phone like the air and maybe next time the fold.

I might get some hate, but the iPhone 17 is the MVP phone of the year in my book.

    ↳ @GlutenForPunishment  👍25  2025-12-15
    No hate your 100 percent correct my dude. This is the base model  update many have been waiting for . Apple is seriously going to sell so many phones this holiday season majority probably base model🤟🏻🤟🏻

    ↳ @kulbeersingh8707  👍0  2025-12-15

    ↳ @King91OM  👍0  2025-12-19
    Hands down the best being offered at that price point. The air is a miss due to many missing features, otherwise it’ll be the MVP for me. Too bad though, will be getting 17 instead.

    It’s interesting to me that there’s such a large fan base of phones and people just following and comparing models outside of just simply needing a new phone every few years. I’m only here to make sure it doesn’t have any fatal flaws like the 15 apparently had lol, but that’s cool you guys are so into phones

What’s good about this gen of iP is that the “Pro” features seem to be truly for Pros because the base provides the need for 90% of use case scenarios. Still, “non-pro” people are gonna status of 3 lenses on their phone.

Switching from a pixel 9 to the 17. So excited! 😁

    ↳ @moatazahmed5111  👍0  2025-12-15
    I did the same but from Pixel 9 pro xl to 17, I love the 17 being smaller, but it does everything the pixel does with more steps. so I feel it's kinda stupid that IOS. for the camera still the pixel provides better photos for sure.

overall it's a very good phone, but the pixel feels way smarter

    do you mean liquid glass as in the apps? i unfortunately don’t think you can turn it off for the home screen and password when you open the phone, but you can change the apps by holding down on your screen after you log in, then clicking edit. you can edit the home screen to become the normal apps again

I have a few questions. I’m considering the iPhone 17 Pro Max because I prefer a large screen — coming from Samsung, big displays are something I really like. You’ve been recommending the smaller iPhone 17, but I want to know if the Pro Max will still fit what I need.

A couple of specific things I’m wondering about:
	1.	Does it still support magnetic charging (the MagSafe style on the back)?
	2.	Will my current USB-C charger work, or do I need to upgrade it because of changes in the new phone?

Thanks!

    @ShaneSymondsYes, I agree. Other than the Dynamic Island on the 15, the base models haven’t really changed much since the 11. With the 120htz display and the camera control on the 17, it’s definitely a good time to upgrade for most people and at a respectable price point.

With the Samsung you can turn the flashlight on if you dedicate the double click option on the power button to do so whether the screen is on or off. That's been a thing for years.

5:08 Bruhhhhhh! Seriously? Comparing iPhone 17 action button with a built-in samsung flashlight button that nobody even heard of? Even S21FE variants turn on flash when screen is on or off with double click if you set it up with lock button. You can even set up another action for triple click. My S24Ultra turns on and off flash with triple ans turns on and off silent mode with double click with lock button. Lame

    ↳ @ShaneSymonds  👍1  2025-12-15
    With it being a dedicated button you'd think it would work well, or at least have settings to change how it functions, but nope the iPhone action button works much better in day to day

    ↳ @Bouncefrog  👍0  2025-12-28
    Exactly

Mine went into incognito mode don't know how or what I touched.  Couldn't get it out of that mode.  Turned phone off and restarted and it wants me to connect to a computer.  Can't get it out of this screen.  What a piece of garbage.

The 6.3 is the perfect screen size imo, bigger than last years 16 base but not too big. Comming from a Razr flip 2023 with a 6.9 inch display the Iphones feels alot more controllable with one hand and I like that.

    ↳ @ZingyOak  👍0  2025-12-15
    6.9 inch for a phone is diabolical

    Air is better 🔥😮‍💨

    @trishuladithya8822respectfully disagree. All show and no substance. Wish I listened to the reviews!!!

    ​@GlutenForPunishmentI like that Apple made the black as graphite in real life, lovely colour.

    @SPFboy86yeah it’s a really nice shade I love it

Wish it had Android

    ↳ @SPFboy86  👍2  2025-12-17
    Then buy an Android. I am glad Apple has its own iOS, not the crappy Android.

I'd rather use a "crappy" OS than a locked down one
