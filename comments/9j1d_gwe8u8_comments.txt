I have used all three and prefer Apple myself. They feel more sturdy and put together, and the ambience mode feels more natural. The weight thing is something to bear in mind for sure. I hate how light and cheap the xm5 feels, and everyone i know tells me I’m wrong for thinking that.

    ↳ @Cookie9060  👍0  2023-05-01
    You own opinion is never wrong if you feel better with them

As a small ear girl: The xm5's got a bit comfortable over the time. They were hurting my head at some point. The noise cancellation made me dizzy. I'm not saying they were thst bad, but i returned them because of this. Plus, i don't like how they look. The sound is a bit better than with the xm4's. But because im a comfy girl, i got the xm4's and they were never hurting. Neither were they falling of my head. The sound is also amazing. Like i said:

Comfy points and good sound: xm4's
Amazing sound and better noise cancellation: xm5's

Do you know what the first steps to shadow a nurse and can you do that at 15?

I bought the WF-XM4 2 years ago and I really love it I'm thinking to buy the WH-XM5 to Study, In some reviews say that noisy cancelling is amazing beside my XM4 hurt sometimes. ❤

Cool anyway if u r not going to use the xm4 u can give it to me always ready to accept

[10] @Yes-ml4bw  👍3  2024-05-13
If you want the best sounding over the head earphones:

Momentum 4. Significantly better than the competition 

If you want the best battery life: momentum 4 and it's not even close


If you want the best noise cancellation: xm5

If you want the best value: momentum 4

If you want the most comfortable: this will be subjective of course however, the ear cups on the momentum 4 and xm5 are the best. BUT, for people with bigger ears, the airpod maxes fit very well. They fit like most open back Sennheiser headphones. 

I am an audiophile so I have quite the collection of headphones. Personally, I have the xm5 and momentum 4s.  I bought the airpod maxes and wanted to keep them because they fit me well but but ultimately returned them because the sound quality is pretty disappointing and the battery life is pathetic.

    ↳ @sukhdevr3489  👍0  2024-12-24
    My momentum 4s sound so bad on my s10+, I think it's because it doesn't support LDAC. HOPEFULLY the XM4s sound better. Even my old q35s sound better because of LDAC and the stronger bass

So for all that sennheiser HD800s is much better.

    ↳ @jlee9360  👍0  2023-04-13
    rock You mean the ability control the sound and an open sound stage?

    ↳ @jlee9360  👍0  2023-04-13
    rock If you add up the headphone costs you can get one for a little bit more. That was the point.

    ↳ @jlee9360  👍0  2023-04-14
    rock I thought the hd800's for 1700 is a steal.

    ↳ @reem-ik  👍0  2025-02-26
    Those are audiophile, studio headphones. Do you think people gonna carry that big ass headphones outside, and for travel?

    ↳ @jlee9360  👍0  2025-02-26
    @reem-ik  people carry the apple version and those are heavier and just as big. Regardless i would travel with them because they are open back.

Here is all you need to know:

Sony XM5: Top of head discomfort due to headband
Sony XM4: Ear discomfort due to not being over the hear
Apple: Ear discomfort due to weight

Solution: XM5 materials with apple head band and peripherals would be the perfect headphone

It's a no brainer tbh.

XM5 > XM4
It's a newer version so why go for the outdated one?

XM5 > Airpods Max
it's lighter
it can connect to 3rd party devices seamlessly
it's newer than the Airpods Max
it has a proper carrying case
it uses USB Type C

and the BEST PART: it's cheaper

It's actually a no brainer. I'm an Apple user, but I also have devices that aren't Apple. Like my Smart TV, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Windows Gaming PC.  So if you look at it in the long run:

XM5 > XM4 and APM

    @osa_tmxies As someone who owned the XM5s and now the Maxes, nah. The fabric cushions of the AirPods are breathable, the synthetic plastic of the XM5 tends to trap heat.

[73] @ceoatcrystalsoft4942  👍1  2023-04-21
I bought the XM4 at the airport because I lost my H9s and I thought they were better despite being $150 cheaper! I think the XM4 can give me a headache if I don't loosen them a bit but definitely think turning off the ambient noise canceling doesn't do a great job so you need to pull them off regardless. Still, they work great when I do want the noise canceled.

Good review and glad to see I could have done worse with the Apple

I definitely agree with the noise cancelling on the XM4s hurting. When I first tried them on, I literally had to take a moment to process what I was hearing when I took one side off 🤣 they’re great. But they also tend to fall off very easily and the side controls are too sensitive - I have a short hair and everytime it brushes past, it turns my music off lol. Long battery life, foldable, very easy connection 👌🏽 I like them nonetheless

i hated my XM4's so much and i only had them for less than 2 months. i don't think i've ever experienced a pair of headphones that create so much sweat as the XM4's and i was so skeptic in upgrading them to the XM5 but i'm so glad that i made the right choice.

BUY the Apple one cause I'm telling you. After few months or a year of using Sony you will notice the cracks on its synthetic leather materials, and if that happends it's no longer attracting and you will just feel embarrassed using it in public.

Ok thank you for this honest review because people were only looking at the Apple ones for like major workout which I’m not using them for so this was so much more helpful. I also want to point out to people that with the Apple ones you can buy covers for the ear muffs and cases to protect it more which I like since I can’t do that for the xm5

[127] @manualidadescoolconnati9342  👍119  2023-03-30
I have the XM4s and honestly, I’m in LOVE with them, the noise cancelling feature is over the top + they’re aesthetically more pleasing than the AirPod MAx’s (in my opinion). The material of the headphones themselves is so soft and has a matt effect, the way you can adjust the volume, change/stop/continue the song all in one headphone is truly amazingfor me, you can also turn on/off the ambient sound on the other headphone. The battery lasts so long, I’ve had them for over 2 months now, I’ve used them almost daily and I’ve only hd to charge them 3 times for like 1 hour. If you’re going to get headphones PLEASE get the Sony ones, either XM4/5s, the sound quality and noise cancelling is amazing on both of them, personally i don’t have a problem of the XM4s shifting on my head but maybe that’s just me!!

    ↳ @saitooku2984  👍2  2023-11-22
    @wiggggyi use the xm4 to sleep :) noise cancellation is perfect however you can’t sleep on your side with it unless you have a slight elevated pillow! and over time the headphones may become looser, depends on how much and how long you use them. when it does turn loose, i just switch to another headphones for 2-3 days and switch back to xm4, and it should turn less loose!

    ↳ @JssD_12  👍0  2023-12-03
    Yes but you're forgetting the part where the hinge that holds the ear cups in place is super flimsy and will break easily if not treated carefully every time. There's countless threads on this topic. I loved the xm4s too but I swapped them out for the xm5s for this very reason. I didn't want them breaking on me out of the blue.

[131] @GabrielCapo24  👍1  2023-06-29
Ex owner of AirPods Max for two years, recently broke. The water condensation build up finally broke one of the ear muffs speakers. The aluminum and heat produced by your body heat gets stuck in between the drivers and the aluminum frame. You can literally see water droplets formed in the speaker of AirPods Max after wearing them for like 45 minutes. You have to take them off and dry them off and let them air dry as parts you can’t dry off manually. Something you don’t and shouldn’t have to do with such expensive headphones. Also this was a huge problem when they first came out, you can literally search it up

------------------------------------------------------------

[132] @thefeistymunchkin  👍1  2023-03-04
I put silicon covers on my AirPods Max’s and it helped a lot! I still wouldn’t wear them if I’m moving around a lot (sit ups, running, etc.) but for genera listening and stationary strength workouts they work so much better with silicon padding 😅

For headphones, specs don't really matter. The only headphones specs that could matter are battery life and charge time. Nobody buys headphones by looking at a specs sheet, even their official websites barely even list numbers or data regarding headphones.

Xm5 for sure. As the noise cancelation is the best. So when need it to be quiet like for example on a plane for long time. Makes it easier to sleep. I'm personally going to be getting those and the new focal with their active noise cancelation. But they also have a built in dac when plug in USB. They are 700 so won't be cheap buying both. But they both serve their own purpose in my life as well.

I had the EXACT same issue with the Sony XM4. On top of that, the market is filled with headphones that cater towards larger heads. I found the BOSE NC 700 was perfect and adjustable for SMALL Asian girly heads. And I love it. The cabin pressure is definitely a lot less (on 10 ANC/NC) vs any level on the XM4. So it’s a clear winner to give BOSE 700 NC for small heads and those that get cabin from the noise cancellation pressure for me. 😊

AirPods are still better sounding imo. (Sennheiser M4 and Focal Bathys, maybe B&K Px7i can match or better it in sound quality). Also you should get the silicone wrap for the headband. Helps with the drift. That being said, you can’t go wrong with XM5.  Even for an Apple user. 😉

[254] @StephG_55  👍0  2023-05-22
I just bought the XM 5s. I find the ear cups are huge for my little ears and since I don't have much hair, they can fall off. The soundstage is more on the Bose 700 side and tech reviewer Flossy Carter pointed out that the drivers are smaller in the XM5s vs the drivers in the XM4. I'm still debating on whether to keep the XM5s or return them.

As someone who was worried about the heaviness of the airpods maxes, it doesn’t actually bother me at all. It doesn’t move around as much cause im using it to study. The transparent mode sounds clearer than my real ears lmao and the audio is really good. I do have to say that when I take a 30 min walk with it, it does get a little sweaty inside. It works like normal airpods, you dont need to turn them on it just automatically connects to your device but having to bring the case is annoying sometimes but you live with it. XM5 and airpod maxes are great. Completely your choice aesthetically at that point and whether you like the ease of use for the apple ecosystem. :)) I barely notice that its heavy and I’m 159 cm (5’2”) and small ears and everything.

I regret my descision of buying the XM5 countless of times after i bought them. I can constantly feel my heart sink almost all the time just by looking at them, because of, you know, the cheap price and me definetly being a millionare. 

But I needed good anc headphones, cause my ability to keep my attention on one thing is shit, so my wallet can burn.

Have them both and a big fan and consumer of Apple products but the Sony XM5 wins hands down . Sony is more comfortable as you mentioned and fortunately offers an off button while APM 2 has no off button. This means that you need to place the headphones in a bulky, flimsy case (bad move Apple) for it 2 close/ savebattery 🪫. As with all apple products the headsets will try to pair with other products iPhones iPads etc  if not in its case - major drawbacks. Love the colors and options they offer but simply not worth it . Maybe future ones will be and if they fix the case and comfort issue. Yeah I agree with what you said and especially if one uses it in the gym or for a walk u need headphones that are more sweet resistant . Great review very helpful, straightforward, and precise. Will def hear u before I buy my next headphones. Thanks.

AirPods Max user here. It’s all a matter of personal preference, I enjoy a lot more the cushion material in the airpods than in the XM4s/5s. It doesn’t warm up my ears as much. And regarding the weight yes it is noticeable, but tbh I never shake my head when wearing headphones so it’s not really an issue in normal use

------------------------------------------------------------

[371] @Arubedo  👍0  2024-08-02
If you don't have small-medium ears xm5 might be uncomfortable pushing on the inside a little. Sound might change or be better to your preferences on either xm4 or Xm5, it's hard to tell without comparing properly but Xm5 might be a little better, I have only tried xm4 and eq's but can presume xm5 is more responsive and clearer but slightly flatter.
Although, I can't justify the price for crappy "statement" headphones even if they have good sound, I just think everything else sucks (in a way but not completely) basically is all apple coded, apple sphere, apple ecosystem bleh. If you like Apple then that's okay so you might justify it, for a crappy brand, that uses their audience for money doesn't fix things under warranty, doesn't't let things fix for a reasonable price and purposefully makes things fail for good profit. "It's just business" and they are not doing it for you.

Heads up to those of you with lots of apple devices.  I have Mac mini, a MacBook Air, 2 iPads and an iPhone and it does not connect seamlessly to any of them.    I can be on a different floor trying to listen to something on my phone and they will randomly connect to my Mac mini.  They will tell me they are connected to my MacBook Air and yet no sound will come out.   Maybe if you just have an iPhone and a MacBook Air it works well but as is it doesn’t

The apple ones are probably just for show, but I also have a new galaxy phone so I thought a Sony would be better. So I've been thinking of either the xm4 or xm5. A few other people have been doing the same three too, or a combo of other brands included, but so funny to see. ❤

    Tbh the apple ones are also basically designer. They are great don’t get me wrong but they aren’t worth the price if you don’t care about the brand. (Also when your walking I have found that the headband clicks a little and that’s slightly annoying)

    ↳ @vhines10  👍14  2023-03-14

I had the xm5s for a week but returned them. I loved almost everything about them, but the arms kept extending when I took the headphones off due to not having a locking mechanism. I thought I had a faulty pair but after doing some research and looking at demo models in person, I saw it was a common issue, so I got the Bose qc instead

I think your review was more about fitting. I surprisingly kept the XM4’s vs 5’s. The value for money was btr since it’s older. Major diff is mic and noise cancellation is worse on xm4. I figured I’d use another mic if calling someone or on zoom and ANC I use it at home so w/e. The other main thing is that I got the xm4 from costco so the return policies are much btr vs getting the xm5 on Amazon. Not to say xm4 is btr than 5 but for these reasons I chose the 4.

I have the XM4 (great headphones)... just received the Apple Max (not liking them that much so far... will continue the “testing” a bit ... and thinking of maybe ordering the XM5 (but not sure why since I like the xm4 so much) ... as far as wireless: I have the XM4 and the Soundcore Space One (just a cheaper $99 wireless that works well) ... the Apple Max are very well built but I do not care for the weight, comfort and sound thus far and at that price those issues make them hard to justify !!! We’ll see what happens

    No, the software for the xm4 is crap. You can’t permanently turn of noise cancellation or speak to chat, both functions will activate when you turn off/turn on the headphones or happen to push the button/make the gesture control associated. So frustrating. Also, there is a common issue that they start to make loud feedback noises, loud enough to give you ringing ears.
