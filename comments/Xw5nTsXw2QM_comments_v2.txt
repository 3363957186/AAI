原文：Hated the Sony XM4. I come from the perspective of a hard core AirPods Pro user and Apple Music listener. The sound quality and noise cancellation features felt cheap compared to the AirPods Max. I took my XM4s to the Apple Store the day I got them to do a comparison test with the AirPods Max, and I could not believe the difference in the music experience. I felt like I was at a private concert in the AirPods Max and felt like I was listening with $30 knock offs with the XM4. Returned it the same day and bought the AirPods Max

[81]  @silaee  👍148  2023-03-23
原文：The best thing to say is that Xm5's have firmware problems i do not recommend them at all. Looking in depth, they can't last as long as their previous products because the 5's don't allow for earcup replacement. The comfort is very very miniscule for a very specific head shape and if you look at reviews for people after a couple months they say they are the most uncomfortable headphones ever because of the pressure (which is why they stay in place but it hurts). 

The noice cancellation is monitored through an AI and you can never have it fully maxed out as it assumes it itself. The AI is horrible and Sony does not care about updating it even though it's just firmware.

And worst part is the earcup shape is actually very very small and if your ears don't fit, you'll experience hell with these headphones. I don't even have big ears but my ears r different shaped from usual people and it me so much, the shallowness also was bad where your ear sits and touches the speaker which is so annoying.

Overall, try them, if they fit you keep them, but if there's even a slight discomfort don't fully go for them as it will get worse and more noticable

Honestly try them both in the store since it comes down to personal preference and comfort

Basically anything will beat them. Koss Porta Pros are 30$ and sound better. If you want to compare sound to something that is worth as much try the famous HD600. Compared to the XM4 or XM5 they are so far better that these sound like one of those cheap headsets that you get in a set with mouse and keyboard.
There are wireless, ANC headphones that are much better than these too, but unless you are constantly near a construction, just get any good closed back headphones instead of these.
They are actually the single most hated headphones amongst headphone people.

原文：maybe the thing where you put the charger broke they r cheap to repair but it could also be a battery problem like over heat or spilling something , if you spilled water on them just let them dry but if its juice then you need to repair them if they just stopped working then should take a toothpick and see if the thing in the middle of the charging hole is dangling if yes then its broken if not its a battery problem if it expanded you need to change it because it could also explode

原文：Many people threw shade at xm5 in the comments but I’m having a pleasant experience with them. I’ve had these headphones for half a year now. I have glasses and small ears without piercings. I find them extremely comfortable (It’s so comfy that sometimes I get sleepy when I put them on while studying.). They don’t fall of my head usually but I found that tying/clippinng your hair back is a good solution. When not listening to anything, the noise cancelling is not perfect but if you start listening something, you won’t hear a thing. I have two cons, though. Firstly there is a setting that can turn off voice cancelling when you start speaking. However it lags a bit and if you have this on, you won’t be able to mumble or sing the song; which annoys me personnally. And the second thing which was also mentioned in the video is that is takes up a lot space in the bag so I can’t carry them around easily. I’ve never had xm4 before so I can’t compare them but I think you would also be satisfied with them for paying a lower price.

I don’t keep them in the case (not a good idea) and they haven’t broken still. My beats were treated the same and they broke on so many occasions for me.

Besides the actual technology, they feel CHEAP. just bought them and my charging port already feels hard like it gets stuck in there. The ear foam part seems fragile and like it will crack and peel with normal wear faster than expected. For $300 I expected way more. I’m sad but I think I’m returning

原文：I've been using the XM3 since 2018 and decided to upgrade to the XM5. For some reason, the XM5 keeps on stuttering or gets distorted audio while in use. It sometimes even shuts down randomly. Apparently, many people experience one or all of these problems with their XM5. There are also many cases online of XM5s breaking at the hinge. After having it randomly shut down for the 5th time since I got it 4 days ago, I just returned the XM5 and will be buying the XM4 instead.

原文：I have the XM4s, but not the XM5. i can definitely second the comfort aspect. I have a stud in one ear and I wear a fishhook in the other, and while I do have to adjust the fishhook when I first put the cup on that ear I don't ever have to readjust, and the ear with the stud is fine without any adjustment at all. I also have no problems wearing them for hours at a time over my glasses.

I do agree, however, that they're not the most secure thing to wear on your head. If I've got both cups on my ears it takes some rather vigorous shaking to dislodge them and I can tip my head all the way forward and all the way back without issue, but I wear them with only one cup on a lot when I'm at home, to ensure that if someone's trying to get my attention they can, and in that state I can't tip my head particularly far back without them falling off, though I can still tip my head forward fine, and it only takes moderate shaking of my head to dislodge them that way.

[242]  @Bully_Biscuit  👍7  2023-12-23
原文：As someone who has had two pairs of the XM4 and one pair of the XM5 do NOT waste your money on these. The xm4’s have a terrible feedback issue that causes loud pitched noise, had this problem with both xm4’s and the second pair had this problem after a few months. Not to mention how the xm4’s also break easily. My first pair broke after not even a full year and the piece holding the headband to the ear cup is so tiny and thin that it’s inevitable for it to break. The xm5’s are too expensive for headphones with adjusting band to not hold its place. That’s right when you adjust the band to the size of your head over the course of you using them within those minutes you will have to keep adjusting it as it slides out of place. The noise cancellation on the xm5’s fluctuates all the time, if you have a fan on you will hear and feel the pressure change and it happens extremely often and for those with sensory issues when it comes to sounds (like myself) it will drive you crazy. 
Don’t get me wrong the noise canceling is great but I suggest going with a different brand of noise canceling headphones as I would like to not have hearing loss from the high pitched noise. Plus these issues shouldn’t be there for a billion dollar companies products. So many others have also experienced these issues.

原文：Imo as someone that owns the xm4s id say the xm3s are probably the best value as they have the better more neutral sound and will quite often go on sale as theyre an older model, they support aptx and aptxhd which the newer ones dont. The xm4 however has some more quality of life features such as the sensor on the left earcup and the auto turn off if not used feature. The xm5s however are NOT worth it at all. Even at 300 I still wouldnt consider the xm5s.

    ↳ ❌ @Ohkeh640  👍0  2023-06-08
    原文：Update: I hardly use them. Only sometimes when working out at home. They don’t get loud enough and the eq settings suck! Also get too hot around the ears and I have a small head they aren’t tight enough on the sides. For the price they’re suck crap quality and crappy sound not loud enough that’s for sure. I stick to my old wireless Powerbeats pro over the ear hook earphones. Even tho the little b logo sticker came off when washing them. They work fine and are water proof and easy to use. Just itch my ear from the silicone rubber but I wash my ears with soap at night and it’s fine etc. ugh the Sony ones I hardly pull out tbh but yeah 
Also the case is uncomfy and ugly and the zip broke on mine so I can’t zip it closed. They’re a rip off in my opinion. Lol

原文：Why get those when you could get ones you can use with a cable or Bluetooth, don't laptops and computers tend to have Bluetooth problems.
Ps; I use the HyperX Could Mix headphones because they're Bluetooth and wired capable and I'm pretty sure they're less expensive then either of these and likely an ok alternative if you don't need to fold them up because my HyperX headphones have always lasted and if I replace them it's because I just want a new pair of headphones. I mean songs are really loud at a bit less than half volume and everything has been clear even at the lowest volume.

Looks like I’m sensitive to the noise cancelling whatever they do to your ears. I put the noise cancelling setting to around half way and I withstand it more easily but it does tire my brain out. But even without turning the noise cancelling on, the over ear design of the 720 is so good.
