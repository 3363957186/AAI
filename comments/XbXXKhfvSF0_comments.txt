Get yourself a dedicated player instead of your phone for music if you're doing high-res audio and pair these with it. Of course, if you're using your phone to play your music, you don't care about sound quality and would be better off with sub $50 headphones

I’ve had both the WH-1000XM4 and the WH-1000XM5 headphones, and unfortunately, I’ve had the same issue with both of them. The left headband hinge tends to break after 2 or 3 years. While Sony is known for its excellent noise canceling technology, I’m hesitant to buy more from them due to this recurring problem. Additionally, the right hinge on the XM5 broke loose just a year after purchase.

i paid that for my Focal bathys.. and they slay them absolutely in sound quality.

    Noise cancelling not as good on the Focal.

    ↳ @Sh4kki  👍0  2025-05-16
    @Phat-rj3jo Which the majority wont even know, because most people play music on it. >>>>>>>> Soundquality > minimal worse ANC.

    ↳ @Phat-rj3jo  👍0  2025-05-16
    @Sh4kkiwell not for me, I travel a lot and I value noice cancelling performance. I have tried Focal and Sennheiser and whatever the sound quality over Sony is negated by their poor ANC. For me the Bathys are in the no man’s land. At home I don’t care for ANC so I go for even better headphones and for travel I prioritize ANC.

    ↳ @Sh4kki  👍0  2025-05-16
    ​@Phat-rj3jo your answer makes no sense. It sounds like. You travel and listen to nothing. While listening to music above 40% you cant hear a difference anymore.

    ↳ @Phat-rj3jo  👍1  2025-05-16
    @Sh4kkiby your logic you should just turn the headphone all the way then you don’t need any ANC. I care about my hearing, I like to listen at a comfortable level without having to turn up the volume to negate poor ANC.

    ↳ @Sh4kki  👍0  2025-05-16
    ​@Phat-rj3joeverything below 70% is safe. So your point is not valid. But enjoy the worst sounding of all anc headphones lol 🎉

    ↳ @Phat-rj3jo  👍1  2025-05-16
    @Sh4kkisounds like you already have a hearing issue, but hey, that’s your ear.

    ↳ @Sh4kki  👍0  2025-05-16
    ​@Phat-rj3jothanks concerning my hearing it's absolutely fine. It's however no surprise that the Xm5 sound terrible. Even the 4s are better. If you would have tested or watched enkugh reviews you would know.

    ↳ @PimpmasterMcGooby  👍0  2025-05-16
    @Sh4kki "Anything below 70% is safe", what a dangerous statement. Anything below 70decibels is safe, with increased volume gradually shortening how long it's safe to listen. And a sidenote, my Bathys were over 80db at around 30%, and since it's powered by the same internal Amp, my 30% should be as loud as your 30% with them, so 70% is absolutely damaging your hearing.

------------------------------------------------------------

[28] @konr7132  👍0  2025-09-26
I was randomly gifted the XM5 not knowing it's GOATed status. Sounds great and battery life is insane. My biggest gripe is all the AI stuff that I can't seem to shut off even with the app. The pausing and switching to ambient is frustrating mid run.

------------------------------------------------------------

[29] @desmondbrown5508  👍0  2025-06-24
Yeah I'm going to go ahead and say, regarding Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra that they outright kind of ruined them vs. Quiet Comfort II.  It is a software mess that randomly just quit connecting to my phone so I couldn't even update them anymore.  And for some reason will only connect to my PC now.  And they feel worse than the Quiet Comfort II's.  It's weird because QC II's were (and honestly still are afaik -- haven't ever tried XM6's) the best feeling headphones ever, but for some reason the buttons on QC Ultra (the supposed upgrade) are cheaper and feel worse, the on/off being a press and wait was a massive step backwards as it's delayed and doesn't always work vs. the snappy response of the switch that just works every single time.

I'm hoping to try these new Sony's out because the ONLY thing at this point they have to beat (they already beat noise cancelling last gen) over Bose for me is to be more comfortable than the QC II's and have FUNCTIONAL connectivity unlike the buggy operation of QC Ultra.  I doubt they will be more comfortable than QC II's, honestly especially when the review mentions sweaty ears after a couple hours, but at this point with the direction Bose has went, I'd rather just have close enough headphones that sound better and have better noise cancelling and just function correctly.  I still regularly use my old QC II's, and they still sell new ones, but I feel like the later batches have had their sound driver deliberately destroyed.  Tested a new pair (after being disappointed with QC Ultra) and they just sound worse than my earlier pair of QC II's.  I guess artificial downgrade to make people want the QC Ultra?  Not sure.

------------------------------------------------------------

[30] @MA_SK_ID  👍1  2025-07-05
Both pairs of my my xm4s ended up with intermittent screeching feedback just after warranty ended. To say it was jarring is the understatement of the year. Feeling a bit gun shy about xm6s.

$449 to have sweaty ears after a few minutes of wearing them? No matter how much useless shit they put into these phones or their horrible app theyre just not worth it.

------------------------------------------------------------

[34] @thesevillages  👍1  2025-05-19
I bought the XM4s a few days ago second-hand for £100. Wouldn't say this lightly, especially about some piece of tech, but they have truly enhanced my life. Walked around town in a peaceful bubble of quietness, reintroducing myself to some of my favourite music.

[37] @freddybellafuca944  👍0  2025-05-20
On the price I'd say that manufacturers have both squizzed the middle men (shops and various distributors) and enlarged margins because when you can, well, why don't you. The good thing is that at that price, some of us will think twice before renewing an already very good headset. Maybe that'll help the environment a tad 🙂

[38] @ramirezlegend  👍0  2025-05-19
Glad these are out but I am perfectly happy with my Mark 5’s. Have had them for almost 3 years now and the battery is holing up well. I use them at the office and on trips all the time, ~40hrs weekly. 

I’ll give it a least another 2 years before thinking of buying a new pair of ANC headphones.

I have the MX5's and they have been good to me. Except the plastic around the hinge on the right side fractured and now the ear phone on that side just dangles by the internal wires. They still work, just the swivel hinge snapped after normal use. The cup design creates pressure onto the ear and that leveraging stress was too much for the cheap brittle plastic. You can tell that the MX5's swivel was an engineering flaw because the MX'6 reinforced the swivel hinge with metal. Can anyone offer advice on how to get my MX5's repaired or replaced? Also is there anyone with hands on experience able to confirm that the MX6's swivel design is more robust and durable? Thanks!

I wish I would of saw this review a few months ago when I bought the bose qc ultra headphones first gen.

It is pretty infuriating when you spend hundreds of dollars on headphones.

WH-1000XM5 was pure garbage.

Unpopular opinion here... Got mine today and have been testing them out extensively. Although they eliminate a lot of the background white noise... A lot of chatter and even the sounds of cars driving by in the distance still get through... Is this supposed to be normal or just my first experience with noise cancelling headphones.  P.S. I have never used noise cancelling anything ever before. And the times the noise gets through is when i am not listening to anything on the headphones. I just leave the noise cancelling turned ON . Is this normal ?

the WH-10000xm5 were the worst set of headphones ive ever owned by far. the sound and comfort was amazing,  but the shear mount of "smart" features they had absolutely imploded the listening experience. want to adjust your earmuffs to fit comfortably? music will pause for 10 seconds when touching them.. want to sing while listening to your music? music will pause for 10 seconds thinking your "talking" to them.. full of stupidity like this.. i strictly used these listing to music on my pc and there was no windows software to fix these issues. i could download an app on my "smart" phone, but that would require disconnecting from my pc, and pairing with my phone via Bluetooth (hopefully works)... once connected i was FINALLY able to disable some of these ridiculous "smart" features... BUT, the most infuriating part was that these headphones would auto update often, resetting all the "smart" features back ON, EVERY. SINGLE.TIME!!!  NEVERAGAIN!!!

10/10 for sound quality but their stupid software's Speak-to-chat feature makes it almost useless for office meetings. 

Imagine, audio being automatically cut-off the moment you start speaking  (at times even if you take a deep sigh). So,  when your co-worker responds you have no idea what they said -till you basically decide to not use the headphones (after apologizing profusely for "technical" issues 🙄🙄)

And yes you can disable it - but believe it or not Sony automatically keeps on enabling it 🤦🏽‍♂. Super annoying feature making the headphones almost useless for taking office calls!

i'm honestly surprised that Marques spoke so highly of these since he travels a LOT and seems to always be on multiple flights every week.  He mentioned that these headphones (and pretty much all other Sony headphones) "make your ears sweat after a couple of hours wearing them".  I'm sure the majority of his flights will last longer than 2 hours, so I personally can't imagine wearing sweaty headphones for that long.  Like most people, when I "demo" headphones, I play certain songs that I'm familiar with looking for specific notes and nuances of familiar tracks.  But lets face it, most headphones north of $300 sound quite nice.  For my wife and I, we travel extensively worldwide (most flights are 10+ hours long) and the only headphones for us that deliver exceptional sound, incredible noise cancelling and phenomenal comfort WITHOUT any ear sweat is Bose.   You almost had me with these, until you mentioned the sweat factor, and I just shook my head again.  I will stick with my Bose knowing I can wear these as long as I want with comfort, excellent sound quality and world class noise cancelling.

I was hoping at least Marques would mention it. But for some reason it seems all reviewers fail to mention the adaptive ANC which cripples the performance. For some reason Sony, and now Bose with the Ultra gen 2, fail to allow you to disable the adaptive ANC. 

And I am strictly talking about the adaptive part. I want the ANC to be at full strength at all times. But it seems these companies know better and want to think for you. It's absolutely horrible and ruins these "premium" headphones. All they need to do is add a toggle in the app to disable it. Why they refuse to do so blows my mind. And why reviewers casually gloss over this also blows my mind, as it was the first thing I immediately noticed upon trying the headphones.

I've come from the XM4s and in comparison, they're only OK, not much better, I principally use them outdoors while doing my 10000 steps listening to Audiobooks, the sound quality is duller then the XM4s and the the responsiveness of the automatic noise cancelation outdoors is useless, it's best to turn the feature off, unless you like amplified wind noise.
BUT they are lighter then the 4s and more comfortable to wear while pounding the pavements. I'm not returning them, but I'm still keeping the 4s for music listening.

The M5s broke after 2 years of use. Never travelled with them, always at my desk. My Bose also broke after two years, impossible to fix. My wife's Linkbud S batteries dead after a year, impossible to replace. On the other hand, I still have all my mobile phones, since my N75 in 2008, in perfect working order, and pretty much all my electronics with an exception of a few blown fuses and bloated batteries which needed to be easily repaired. 

When it comes to headphones, it seems they are built to last a youtuber's review, and then that's it.

In High School I always saw ppl w the grey XM4s and they looked so Nice I knew I always wanted them.
I bought some when the XM5s dropped because the XM5s didnt seem like a good enough jump from the XM4s for me.

I look forward to getting my hands on some XM6s.

And a brand new pair of XM4s just cuz i like mine so much

great review. I have couple of questions though. How is the clamp force and how is the comfort and cushioning around the headband and ear cups. I saw few reviewers complain about the comfort of the headphones, specially around the ear cups, stating the earcups cushioning  is very thin and the noise cancelling unit is protruding outside which can hurt many ears. Can you please clarify and share your thoughts around these concerns.

As someone with a shaved head who's owned and loved both the XM4s and XM5s but had to sell them because they became painful to wear in like an hour or so thanks to the thin headband digging into my scalp, I sincerely hope this one's more comfortable.

    ↳ @rossyboy1980  👍0  2025-05-15
    @Puddles4ETN It suits the majority of consumers, that's why it's sells so well. You have to suit the masses, most of whom want it to weigh as little as possible.  To think you're more important than the larger audience might require a little self reflection. Hair is free you know.

    ↳ @Puddles4ETN  👍0  2025-05-15
    @ If their competitors can make comfortable headphones without making them annoyingly heavy, I don’t see why Sony shouldn’t be able to as well. Even the AirPods Max are way more comfortable than the XM4 and XM5, despite weighing like 50% more.

    ↳ @rossyboy1980  👍0  2025-05-15

    @rossyboy1980 no, sony does not have to appease a bald person but telling this person to just grow out their hair was such a dumb response.
Also, if it's comfortable for a bald person, would it not be more comfortable for us people with hair? Why are you mad for lmao

    ↳ @aidenkz  👍0  2025-05-15
    @rossyboy1980  What about people who can't grow hair
Ultimately, it comes down to a potential consumer voicing why they won't get it
Sony can choose to take this feedback if they see it or just ignore it and lose every other bald person that agrees
I'm sure they'll do just fine either way unless everyone becomes bald
And here comes you catching feelings because a person chooses not to grow hair lmao

    ↳ @rossyboy1980  👍0  2025-05-15
    ​@aidenkzah, but that wasn't the initial complaint. He was moaning that it's uncomfortable because he chooses to shave his head. To complain that a company doesn't cater to his choices is wild in my humble opinion.

    ↳ @aidenkz  👍0  2025-05-15
    @rossyboy1980  he gave his experience lmao
He didn't say "sony is garbage because they are uncomfortable on my bald head that I choose to shave"
He gave genuine feedback
He like them
He had to sell them because they were uncomfortable on his head
The straps are too thin
They dig into his scalp
Informative, respectful feedback from HIS perspective
No doubt other people share that feeling too
Choosing to shave his head is irrelevant information, tbh but he's trying to say he's bald
Anyway, that's my take on this. 
It's not worth further debating regardless of who's right

    ↳ @rossyboy1980  👍0  2025-05-15

The only issue with Sony's is that, since the XM5 iteration, earcup size has been reduced, for big ear guys like me they are a big no, they aren't as comfortable and do not isolate as well, which is pretty much the point of an ANC system. So, saying they are the best is a big stretch when taking into account other factors which are just as important. So, for the average joe, they could very well be the best, but not for every case.

I have the XM6 and actually HATE the Sony Connect app, it's confusing compared to the Samsung Wearable app that I use with my Samsung Buds 3 Pro's. BTW, Sony has ALWAYS been obsessed with BASS.. remember their MEGA BASS switches on their CD and Cassette players? I REALLY hated it.. I'm not a BASS fan. I got these XM6 on a promo for $180US (for people who sells these for a living) and would NEVER buy these at full price for $450US, 100% not worth it and it feels like cheap plastic. These things are worth at best $200US. Maybe I'm spoilt since I have access to a lot of high end headphones but honestly these are not worth full retail. If I was to pay full retail for a pair of headsets then I'd probably get the Bose QC Ultra but I'm happy with the XM6 for the price I paid (almost third of retail). All I can see is not much has changed in the headphone world since the original XM1 and QC45 ..

Ive been wearing my xm5’s for like  2.5 years now, the leather is slightly starti by to peel on the headband, otherwise they have just been absolutely godlike, best purchase ever. Absolutely getting the xm6’s if i run into any problems in the future with my xm5’s.
I just wish they were more water/sweat resistant to not need to worry about working out in them

    Yeah I just simply don’t workout in them. I prefer ear buds for working out like AirPods. Everything else unless it’s raining I’ll be using the xm6. Great headphone just gotta look after it and not throw it about and you shouldn’t have any issues. Also getting  extended warranty or repair with a retailer you purchase from is probably smart with how expensive these are £400 in the uk at the moment

I had XM5, after a few thousand hours of use the sliders died so it was always on max size. The battery capacity went to 40% and the touchpad had non stop ghost touches so i was listening to beeps all day long.
Read many ppl online have the same problem, dont trust that XM6 wont have these problems for sure. Dont wanna risk it.

Switched to Bowers&Wilkins PX8, sounds better, has almost as good noise cancellation, better clamp force, looks better, is more durable and made of better materials, doesnt have any of the aforementioned problems.

Highly recommend

Perfect timing. My XM4 just crapped out last night. I 100% got my money worth out of them. Used them for thousands of hours through movies, music, gaming, gym, and work.  Was reviewing XM5 this morning and see these were just released today. My XM4 were perfect. I have the WFXM5 and they're great, but nothing like over the ear. Definitely ordering these today.

    Ignore what the other person said they're overly negative. Enjoy your XM6's I'm definitely jealous. These improve a lot of things that I hated about the XM5s like the non rotating hinges and the big case and the hinges. I wish I had the money for the price tag these are at lol.

    ↳ @northsideshorty  👍0  2025-06-02
    Could you please tell me bro, did you buy them and what is your opinion on them?

    ↳ @lbnyrider5666  👍0  2025-06-02
    @northsideshortyYes, I purchased them that day, delivered following week because I wanted the silver color. 
But just as the XM4, incredible sound but with MUCH better noise cancellation. With only moderate volume level and noise cancellation on, the outside world is absent. So for example at gym, don’t hear any loud banging of metal weights from other, or stomping feet on treadmills, or the gym music. 
There is more room for your ear inside the ear cuff, and just generally more comfortable. 
It is notably faster in connecting to devices than the xm4. 
Honestly as of right now the only two minor downsides I can think of is that it doesn’t say “power on… Power off” when turning on and off. It just makes that little dull thump sound, even when disconnecting from a device. So sometimes unsure if I turned it on or off. 
And the other is that it connects to multiple devices automatically. So if I want to use it on my computer and I turn on and hit connect it will, but will then also automatically connect to my phone. But sound is coming from my computer but then if I’m scrolling through my phone and try to hear the sound, it’s not coming from phone or headphones, so then I have to disconnect my Bluetooth for a second. So that’s annoying. 

So if you are in need of new headphone, I highly recommend. I just prefer Sony sound profiles over many others, Bose is my second. 
I use them for music, TV, Gaming and work calls.

    The cheap, flimsy looking construction of the XM5 between the headband and earcup is one of the reasons I went with the XM4 instead.  The other was the lack of compact folding for travel.

    ↳ @viktorbihar5384  👍1  2025-05-15
    Some people are saying that the "cafe mode" feature is pointless because lo-fi tracks exist, but let me make a good point that turns the tables, it's a very obvious point to make and highlights why that idea is more less wrong, and kinda stupid.

First off, I've listened to Lo-fi music before on my Sony XM5's, and straight up, it does not sound like I am in a cafe, so you either have questionable hearing, or poor awareness, I dunno, your pick. Second, you do know that speakers and headsets can fire sound in slightly different directions if support for such a feature is coded into the software, right? 

Lastly, this is not the reason someone is buying these😂 But who know's? For instance, I'm going to try this feature, but I am more excited by the fact that they actually brought back the OG collapsable design, managed to make ANC better, and the sound is better too, which brings me to another point.

NO, EQ can NOT make your headset sound the same, why? Because it's not the EQ that is the main character here, it is, once again, the drivers in the headset. Depending on your drivers, certain EQ settings can actually make it sound worse because your drivers cannot accurately recreate the frequencies you are hoping for, and sometimes it works, but it can sound muddy. So the fact they were able to improve the drivers makes a big difference from the already amazing XM5's, Is a surprise because corporations like Sony usually barely change anything in their products. I Remember watching reviews on the XM5's, and tech channels were using the flat, base EQ. This means they listened to them the way they sound out of the box, so there is no bias, and they were right because my experience matched what they were talking about.

So anyway, I will hopefully be getting mine, and I hope I am not wrong here. Good thing I can always hit that return button and explain things that might make Sony try harder next time. Thank God sound is one of the harder things to fake, because of how "fragile" sound waves can be, especially when it's coming from a very small space.

    ↳ @jayfiled  👍0  2025-05-15

    Personally , Feels more like a gimmicky feature. It’s like they give you high quality and close and loud speakers, then give an option to not use them, to make you feel like it’s a distant noise. A low budget echo or a normal phone on low volume can give you the same effect; as that’s exactly how cafe music works. It’s a music system on low volume which isn’t near your ear. So at this point you could just play your music on a speaker far away, rather than buy a high volume high quality speaker to not use them

    Never had a problem with my XM4s. My ideal wishlist was the ability to ANC out more people's talking, third device connection, and maybe some physical buttons, since I had some unintentional input with the touch. With a rocker for volume up/down that doubles down as skip or previuos if long pressed and a play/pause button (both of these could fit on the "blank" side), you have covered 99.9% of usecases

    ↳ @aurelisdnb  👍0  2025-05-16
    I have a love-hate relationship with them. They sound and feel great, but have a ton of software issues. There's been so many times I wanted to throw them out because of the speak to chat mode constantly turning on, the headphones randomly stopping working and not turning on, the headphones disconnecting on windows VERY often especially when switching media. Also sometimes hearing electrical component noise in one of the earpads. Maybe I just have a bad pair, but the list of issues is just too long...

    ↳ @riccardopezzani  👍0  2025-05-16
    @aurelisdnb TBH I have disabled most of the useless functions. I believe them to be in the favor stable connections over quality (I need big range when gardening). I had controller/headphone issues with my window desktop until I connected the proper antennas and that fixed the problem, without them it's all crap. BUT, if you hear those noises, there is a real possibility that your pair is either defective or a bit broken due to hits, water/sweat or other damage that may be occurred and that may explain the bad connection too

    ↳ @davidsaunders2893  👍1  2025-05-17
    @VibhavSinha Mine used to do that (right headphone only) with noise cancelling on. If I recall correctly it has to do with a feedback loop due to one of the mics getting dirty or something like that. There are videos on YT of how to fix it. The sound truly is ear shattering though so I understand your hesitation to wear them after.

I am not sure whether Marques has actually used the QC Ultras for an extended period of time, but there's no universe in which they're flat out "better" than the XM5s or XM6s. For one, I find the sound quality is not even comparable (Bose beats these by a very wide margin), and the ANC is a lot better in many cases. I have both the XM5s and the QC Ultras.

As for others, comparing these to Sonos, JBL, and Beats (Beats, really??) yeah, of course the XM6s are better because they're not in the same league.

I got the Sony WH-1000XM3 in 2018 and haven’t looked at another pair since—just replaced the ear pads once, and the battery still lasts over 30 hours since I mostly use them with AUX. Can’t believe it’s almost been 10 years and the tech still holds up—still relevant, still top quality, and worth every rupee

    ↳ @GRamerDim  👍1  2025-05-15
    they can be powered by aux? I thought it was just for connection?

    ↳ @hiteshgarg9398  👍13  2025-05-15
    Where did you get the ear pads from? I've got XM4 and couldn't find their original pads anywhere.

    ↳ @derekkreykes3757  👍3  2025-05-15
    Same, although I finally got the XM5s last October but keep my XM3s around for the gym and housework

    ↳ @jelmervanderzee7245  👍0  2025-05-15
    I have the same, only the original jack cable broke down at a certain moment. I realised after that point that most jack cables of 6.3 wouldn’t fit propperly as the ‘input length’ of the cable was not long enough or the width of the plastic was to thick to make a propper connection. Anyone else had the same issue?

    ↳ @kamael1125  👍4  2025-05-15
    Same. Although I never change pads. And they are long overdue for new ones. I do have to say, if these were 100 cheaper, I would have purchased them. For 450...that's too much for this type of headphones. 

It's the same story every time. One company (Fapple I'm looking at you) charges BS price for their product. Bunch of Fappists buy it regardless. And rest of the companies says...well. Since Fapple charges this much for their stuff. We can too!

    ↳ @mizuki024  👍14  2025-05-15
    Same here, I heard that XM3 is actually better than 4 and 5, so I never replaced my XM3.

I read somewhere that for high-quality headphones, the audio driver can last up to 30 years, so you simply need to replace the earpads every few years.

    ↳ @FuturePortal911  👍0  2025-05-15

    Lmao. Same. I’m using my XM3s too. Still perfect. I changed the ear pads last year. Good as new. Battery still lasts long. I only upgrade when I need to. At this rate I probably won’t upgrade till like XM8s or something. Lol

    Using the aux cable sounds bad unless you also power them up so the battery still gets used. Mine are still going strong and survived being submerged in coca cola, they're bomb proof. Well the plastic snapped and I fixed them with black tape a few years ago, still no reason to ever get a newer version. They're the best product I've ever got. Also got them for $50 on ebay in 2019 with the plastic already snapped, didn't matter at all, tape fixed in ten seconds. The new ones look worse also

    ↳ @michael_c2  👍0  2025-05-15
    ​@GRamerDimI just looked it up, and sadly when the battery goes the bypass feature is gone. It's quite possible it uses less battery I don't doubt that and so maybe that's prolonging the life of the product. But it's still ultimately a consumable within your replaceable battery so it's not a long-term option. Eventually the xm3 lovers will have to find an alternative. If you have some older stuff that legitimately has quadruple a solutions you can keep them for much longer. Hassle of course having to rely on the batteries and it's not cheap but it is nice to know that they're not completely waste to after 5 or 10 years

Interesting that you say the comfort is top notch. When all other reviews I have seen have said that the comfort is not good. Maybe its because its said to be bad for ppl with glasses and you dont wear glasses.

    ↳ @stolatoskc  👍0  2025-05-15
    Yes the price is too steep. Just because they can, doesn’t mean they should price it like that.

    ↳ @Sazon_G0ya  👍1  2025-05-15
    I believe they’re basing the price from apples sales records from their headphones of the same class. People bought $550 apple headphones, surely they’ll buy $450 sony headphones.

    ↳ @prateekpanwar646  👍0  2025-05-15
    ​@Sazon_G0ya I heard them, They do have similar NC to Boss QC, treble on high side and small-medium soundstage. All they charge for is metal body and design which no one cares in a headphone.
You could just pick an XM4 and get better experience overall or even airpods 4 + NC instead of Max.

There is absolutely no way these are any good. Every time I use a pair of headphones that gets a glowing review they suck so hard and hands down are the worst for phone calls... They have sharp loud jaring system sounds. They fucking cost more than everyone else and they are worse. This has to be paid sponsorship along with any other Sony headphones review.

A big design flaw of the XM4's that I never see mentioned is that while the touch controls can be disabled, the beeping noise it plays in the headphones when it registers a touch CANNOT be turned off. 
I commute by train and it's something to do with the electrical fields that causes the touchpad to constantly register touches.
I contacted Sony about this and it's "working as intended".
I the end, the only way to fix it was to open up the headphones and physically disconnect the touch pad cable.
Can the touchpad can be fully disabled on the XM6?

[457] @nine182  👍0  2025-06-04

I have the xm2's and they've travelled all over the world with me and have been a staple in my daily commute. They're starting to show their age, mostly the battery, and I'm thinking of upgrading soon so i might just stick with what i know. Yes they are pricey but of they hold up as well as my 2's do after 8 years of heavy use it's worth it to me

[470] @AXHEJAZ  👍0  2025-12-13
To the product manager: Sony please listen carefully, I just purchased the WH-1000XM6 headphone, the extender adjustment feels cheap and isn't intuitive or smooth when adjusting. I don't know why you're going backwards, the noise canceling has been reduced it's weaker than the predecessors. Sound quality is excellent and the EQ overall is excellent but you need to work on the extender adjustment and the noise canceling. And it is not comfortable to wear at all it puts way too much pressure on my head. In my opinion the WH-1000XM2/3/4 had the best adjustment method and the absolute best noise canceling system especially the XM4's, maybe it has to do with the on-ear versus the over ear cups. Also, was the most comfortable to wear and to personalize in terms of adjustment and comfort. From one Sr. Product Director to another, this is the best decision Sony can make. Unfortunately I'm returning the headphones back to Best Buy. Sony is a phenomenal brand and I don't want the word "cheap" or  "backwards" to be associated with the brand. I have so much respect for the brand. That's why I reached out.

With the 6's did they fix how aggressive the dynamic ANC was in the 5's? I ended up returning mine because the ANC would get all wonky if the air pressure changed in the slightest around the microphones.

It made them extremely annoying to wear around town and I absolutely hated the 5's because of it.

Sound is trash now. 30mm speakers for a 500$ headphone is a joke. Especially for one that needs to cancel noise. That's too much pressure on one small speaker. And you can tell. The bass is no longer there. No where near the xm3. It has peaks and dips all over the frequency response. So you can't even argue they sound balanced. It's just bad. They need to bring back the 40mm drivers that took the throne. Not these money grab gimick trash cans.

Took them to a repair shop, and while it worked for a while, the issue came back after three months. Pretty disappointing for such a premium pair. Makes me question whether it’s even worth spending the money on the XM6.

Reviews of these often neglect the voice recognition for things like battery status.  You can say “hey headphones battery check” and it will tell you the battery level.  Many other commands also.  Additionally, the auto power off and actually having a power switch is great.  I have the AirPods Max which lack this features and feels much more uncomfortable the then Sony.  Nice to go quickly into transparency mode by just holding my hand over the right side speaker to hear an announcement etc is great.

I bought the xm4's last November and they are absolutely incredible, 0 complaints so I can't imagine how good the 6's must be. $449 isnt that bad when you consider you could buy the 4's or 5's for much cheaper and still get most of the quality and I guess if you want the best then get the 6's. Beautiful design as always too.

Hello.    I bought and use these as my main setup for PC use.     I have a 2025 gaming rig that supports BT 5.3 - or maybe even 5.4    When connected via bluetooth, I am only offered up to 48000hz or DVD quality. Is there something I am missing?   I know these are capable of studio quality with BT.   Why is it not available?

The Bowers PX7 1st Gen are still untouched for me, and I’ve had the XM4s, the sound is just not as clear. Although the XM4s did have a better comfort for travelling, I use my AirPods Pro’s for that anyway. If I’m buying headphones, sound is the priority for me, and then everything else, although important, is still secondary.

    @kjrom I had the XM5’s and the XM4’s, and the XM4’s headband snapped right where it connects to the earcup. It seemed like there was a metal band inside, but it probably ended at that junction, leaving the connection point all plastic. That weak spot just gave out over time.

It’s probably an issue with the XM5’s also

    Been using my XM3s I bought in 2021 (in HIGHSCHOOL)! They were refurbished and discounted since the XM4s released around that time. 4 Years later and the only thing that broke on me was early 2024 when the notice cancelling (which i barely used because of the pressure making me kinda uncomfy) started making my right ear uncomfortable (not sure how to explain it lol). I think that was due to the refurbish as its the same side that the repair was seemingly done.

    I've had these same WH-1000XM3s for many years, and mine also still work perfectly, and look in much the same condition as when I first bought them!...I've been waiting with such eager anticipation for this 6 incarnation, because this was the version which I decided quite a while ago that I would upgrade to if I was gonna stick with Sony!...Just hope that many more reviews corroborate the promise of these 6s!!  😙🤞🤞

Never had similar problems ever again by now. I will probably buy the new XM6 at some point, even though my XM3 is still in very good conditions.

    I'm still rocking the OG release of this series (XM1?) that I got when they first came out.

    Wearing my XM3s right now, which still work, sound and look pretty much like new. Only very minor wear on the original ear cuffs, but not enough to warrant replacement even on those. One of the best tech purchases I ever made. Life changing is not hyperbole. They have seriously upped my quality of life due to being able to have access to peace and quiet anywhere, anytime. Can’t tell you how many situations that has saved for me.

Biggest upgrade for me might be that they finally made those hinges out of metal.....every damn headphones I have had in the last couple of years (also very expensive ones) break on the hinges, and they always claim it's your fault. I hope these are more durable than the XM5s. Mine broke after a year, and I don't do anything other than sitting in place listening behind my PC at work...

[703] @raphaelg7122  👍0  2025-08-09
Pretty sure the XM5 design changes were downstream of all the previous XMs having very nasty cracking issues in the frame when pulling on and off (cracks would appear along the tabs on the arms) (XM5 doesn’t have that)

XM5s are more durable from less moving parts, but of course not foldable!

I think this design is tackling the frame cracking problem with their new hint

The biggest strength of Sony headphones is their LDAC connection, which is not available on iphones. If you have an iPhone, you aren't getting the full value out of these. I would even go so far to say that if you have an iPhone, there's really no point in buying expensive Sony headphones, and you should probably get something like the Air Max (or whatever it was called) which allows for better quality connections with iphones. 

If you're on Android, make sure you enable the LDAC connection and also use a high quality music source.

    ↳ @SteveHuffer  👍4  2025-05-15
    I doubt whether anyone could tell the difference between iOS AAC and LDAC on these, let alone with the use-case for ANC headphones. I had the XM4 connected to my Android and iPhone and the only difference was that the AAC was louder, like for like. Differences can be heard at 128kbps, but not 256.

Don't get me wrong; I have loads of LDAC gear and use it when necessary for my Arya Stealth, but even then I'm really doing it just because it's there, rather than any perceived difference.

    I still love mine but they're going. I have dropped them a bunch. The strangest thing is that the audio isn't getting worse, the noise cancelling is. I guess the microphones got messed up and they get feedback sometimes. But if nose cancelling is off, they still work as headphones. Weird.

    @stickfigure9138and the condensation that shorts out the circuitry leading to the static sound. Mine did that after a season in the summer and started playing static in the left earcup only which felt like a mosquito buzzing in your ear. 
Definitely don’t recommend those for people who tend to be more sensitive to heat or living in hot humid climates.

    ↳ @chrischoy9  👍1  2025-10-20
    @Darkness251just be careful of the 3rd party ones. They degrade the ANC and alter the sound signature. Although I never got to replacing the ear pads on my XM3 before they suffered from the static issue, in my Bose, the differences between an OEM and a quality aftermarket was immense.

Sony headset hinges are problematic in folding mode. They eventually break. Why reintroduce this technique? Even though I like Sony's noise-canceling model, this is a real problem. Since I bought my Sony 100mx2, I haven't dared to buy one.

lol the one thing that annoys me with my XM5s is that they heat up, and it sounds like that is the one thing they haven't updated!

I think it might be worse because I have a big head, so they are maybe tighter on me than on some others.

Not that I'd really have the budget to upgrade frivolously anyway, I bought the XM5 in the first place because I view good noise cancelling headphones as just basic accessibility for being autistic and wanted something durable with a case as well. The hope is I'll get my moneys worth before they inevitably someday break and I have to get whatever the current gen is.

I don't think the audio quality on them is all that bad, but changing the EQ setup is a requirement. Some good suggested settings still floating about I imagine. I wonder how many people complaining about audio quality never touched the EQ.

    ↳ @formless7000  👍0  2025-05-15
    Using them at home every day and they're comfy all day long. Sound is great and noise cancelling is nice when there is distracting outside noise or neighbors are loud. Most of the time I don't even use ANC cause the passive NC does a good job by itself. Battery lasts at least 2 full days with a mix of ANC on/off and just charging it for 5 minutes makes it last for a couple hours.

    ↳ @haseebmohammed3728  👍0  2025-05-15

    I have the XM4 and would agree that this Sony offers the best sound and value in a wireless NC headset.  That said I also own the Bose QuietComfort 25 (12 years running) and still think those sound better than the Sony WH-1000XM4.

    @seya_2  That's the downside of all the wireless crap we buy today.  If you're in the Apple garden they you're screwed since you can't easily use their products in wired mode without some adapter.  I use my Bose QC25 (wired only) on planes with Samsung Android tablets on planes that have real audio jacks.  It sounds better than my XM4 Sony in wireless NC mode.

    I mean at the biggest criticism of those was the sound signature out of the box.  They have a reputation for being muddy but I don't know that's probably what a lot of consumers like

    In this category you can’t beat the Sennheisser Momentum 4s for sound quality. Sony XM4 and Bose QC not even close. But the noise control is bad. Real bad. If these new Sonys are even close to the  Sennheissers for sound quality then I might considering to upgrade

    ↳ @MrEverisforever  👍0  2025-05-16
    I'm using them right now and they're great but I've had lots of issues with mine. The side button randomly taps so much that I've had to permanently disable it and yes restarting the system does help but then it just eventually happens again and Sony won't fix it/deny that there's an issue. Also the speak function sucks and goes off when you cough so I've disabled that as well. But overall they're still good.

    I bought those and was seriously disappointed, especially for their price point.
Maybe I just got a bad unit, but literally every function I bought these headphones for isn't working properly.

Build quality is really bad, rattles and squeaks.
The fit could be way better, every time I move my head or even when the train shakes from left to right slightly the ANC gets super glitchy and doesn't properly recover unless turned off and on again, imbalance between L/R and a hand full of other complaints.

Returned it within two months of purchase because of how bad these problems seemed to get.

    ​@Maxible - You're not alone, it's not just your head. My husband and I HATED the XM5s (as did a few of our friends) and returned them because they were so uncomfortable. 
We each have the Bose QC Ultras now which feel like a soft pillow on our head and ears compared to Sony. 
It's too bad because we loved our Sony XM3's and the battery life with Sony is definitely better than Bose but the XM5's felt like a torture device so we're now a Bose household until Sony designs a much more comfortable headphone.

    One thing I liked about the 4’s was the proximity sensor inside the left ear cup and I wish they kept that.  A gimmick?  Maybe, but I like how you can take them off and it instantly pauses and then immediately resume the second they’re back on.

I still have my 4’s since it was released and they’re still rockin’.

    I've been using the same XM4s for 5 years now. I absolutely love them! I'm only looking at the XM6s because the ANC is not working properly in the left ear cup anymore, likely due moisture damage. Also because they're are the newest model, obviously. I want to try the XM6s before I decide wheter or not I'll just buy a new pair of XM4s. If anybody wants to share their thoughts on this dilemma, feel free.

    The 4s are great but after a long life of use the leather on the ear cups has degraded due to sweat and they have small bugs that show their age. Will be getting these, however the only improvement I want to see from Sony with a next gen model is replaceable ear cups with better ventilation - although I imagine the ventilation makes the noise cancelling worse.

    ↳ @lOycab  👍0  2025-12-19
    Watching this in late 2025 and the XM4 is still the GOAT.. at least for me. 

The fact that Sony brought the folding hinge back for the XM6 just proves the XM4 design was right all along. 
You get 90% of the performance for half the price. (Putting fresh earpads helps)."

State of Sony headphones in 2025:
XM6 ($450): Great, but expensive. Proof that folding headphones are superior. 
XM5 ($350): The awkward middle child. Doesn't fold, huge case.
XM4 ($200): The Value King. Still top-tier ANC and sound for nearly half the price. Great value, classic foldable design, and punchy bass.

If you own XM4s, you're not missing out. You're just saving money.

XM4 already supports LDAC (Sony's high-quality audio codec). 
You aren't missing out on major sound quality features by sticking with the older model.

Even in 2025, XM4 beat the XM5 on design (folding) and beat the XM6 on price. 
The XM4s are the Windows 7 of headphones.

One of the best tech investment I've made.

2:53 i like my xm5 that I've had for 3+ years already but seeing these improvements really makes my regret buying my headphones 😔 I'm not going to switch up any time soon cause they work great and all but I've definitely noticed i these downsides like them being huge so i stopped taking the case with me when i travel and eventually just stopped taking them with me if i expect to take them off, how inconvenient it is to not be able to angle them down when on my neck and how i always have to feel the buttons for a few seconds to make sure i am pressing the correct one (or i just take them off to press the button which is even stupider 😅)

Thank You Sir you are so knowledgeable about Headphones  this review really helped me on my decision to get this model. I already own the WH-1000XM3 and I love those but I’m looking for even more features and upgraded noise cancelling.

As an audiophile, disregarding for accessibility and convenience, audio wise, I could never find any of the 1KXM every appealing to the ear, all you hear is overloaded bass, very bloaty and unnatural sounds. It literally sounds like a dj speaker attached right to your ear and one would think that that is how good sound sounds like

The M4 are half the price and 90% of the product. They are definitely the way to go especially when you consider the microphones on M6 are not significantly better and they have simply become more bulky.

Dear Fultime filmaker, l hope l find you well ,My name is Takunda Mukarati, Im studying IT at Midlands State University and I’m reaching out with deep respect and hope in my heart.

I’m passionate about music video direction,short films commercial production, and video editing. I’ve been working hard to build my skills and take steps toward my dream, but right now I lack the proper equipment to bring my vision to life.

I’m hoping to acquire essential gear like a professional camera, gimbals, tripods, and a powerful editing machine. These tools would help me shoot quality music videos, create compelling ads, and continue growing as a creative.

If there’s any way you could help me or point me in the right direction, I would be incredibly grateful. Even just hearing from you would mean the world to me.

Thank you for inspiring people like me all around the world to dream big and stay kind.

Sincerely,
Takunda Mukarati

Been on a pair of xm4's for about a year now. Probably the best bang for your buck option in the audio space in general (and they still sound crazy premium). If I had the cash I would probably check out the 6's, but 500 is a little steep for me.

I don't spend a lot on tech, I usually use something till it's at the point it needs a replacement, my one exception is headphones. I have been using this series of headphones since the WH-1000X, and with each new iteration, I purchase them. I am a headphones power user, to the point (I know it's not healthy), but I often sleep in them (Busy city outside my window). So far, the XM4 were my favourite, but the XM5 have been a very reliable partner to have. This series of headphones has been unbeatable to me. I often tried other headphones like the Bequite but this is just always a cut above. I'll be purchasing these. Thanks for the review MKB, top quality as always.

These Sony headphones are pricey but after buying them, I was so surprised as it turned off all the chatter around me.  I checked out my Samsung S8 Ultra tablet's settings and clicked on Bluetooth.  Turned it on and with my headphones showing up I clicked on them and I heard  "bluetooth connected".  I had to look for my audio setting on the tablet and increased the volume but no sound ?  Just then, I realized the video wasn't playing so started the video and man was the sound was so clear but yet it doesn't feel like its directed into your ears but more like sound all around your head with no earphones on ?   Value for money, they're very light and yes your ears will get sweaty after a few hours so grab a few tissues, lift and wipe behind your ear and to the same with the other.  Suffer the pain, buy these and know these are value for money.

Just warning everyone: You're not going to be able to buy OEM replacement ear pads. So once yours expire, and they will, you will only be able to get shitty third party ones that break ANC and make them sound worse.
The XM4s have the same problem. This is planned obsolescence.

[963] @merforceone  👍0  2025-11-20
I tried these headphones after watching this video but after 1 trip I returned them. It has some cool features but ultimately too many weaknesses to make them better than my old pair of Bose. Due to the rotation of the headphones during storage, they tend to want to revert to this twisted position while on your head, so after 2 hours of wear on a plane, one side was pressing on the front of my ear and on the other ear it was pressing toward the back. Not comfortable. This also affects its ability to effectively cancel noise because it can’t stay stationary around your ears. For the price, these are not worth it.

07/08/2025 - Review of the Sony WH-1000XM6
I will be honest, I was watching the review and I was thinking was this video sponsored by Sony? The review didn't seem as genuine as it could be and the review was more targeted for an audience who plan to purchase the latest model and then purchase the next latest model that releases, not for an audience who plan to purchase and own the headphones until they break/ wear down from old age. In my opinion the new latch case will be worse in terms of longevity from the rubbing against things in a bag and then not clicking anymore. So, to put it simply, I genuinely feel that there has been a downgrade in the case design from a longevity point of view.

    The headset profile has been very neglected for a long time.  If I remember right, with BT LE Audio (5.2 or something), there will finally be a higher bitrate default headset profile.

    Complete trash mic. Actually Sony has some real problems with their mic integration. I own the original 1000mx, link bud s and both have quite shitty sound quality the moment you are on a call (music quality is good). I had to return the xm4 in ears due to this and bought a samsung bud pro instead. Sony should learn from samsung on how to integrate ANC, voice and mic together. Otherwise just sell to people who only listen to music and never talk to others.

    ↳ @MikkoRantalainen  👍0  2025-05-16
    The problem with Bluetooth is that we still do not have any better headset protocol in the Bluetooth baseline spec than we had a couple of decades ago.

Modern Bluetooth would have enough bandwidth to *always* support 48 kHz PCM audio to the headset and mono 48 kHz PCM audio from mic to the host device. However, the protocol doesn't guarantee such protocol so device manufacturers do not create support for it.

The only thing you can trust to always work is year 1998 SBC audio which is roughly GSM phone quality.

    ↳ @MikkoRantalainen  👍0  2025-05-16
    @Paroque28 Unfortunately, all the improved audio features are still *optional* even with Bluetooth 5.2. LC3 may or may not be supported and SBC is still the "best" you may end up with if you only look for "Bluetooth 5.2" without reading actual reviews about the real world hardware compatibility between devices.

    ↳ @poomunj  👍1  2025-05-16

    ​@JMurph2015you got it! And for everyone else, no matter how many mics we have. If the phone and the headset are not using the lc3 Kodak on the new Bluetooth 5.3, the mic will sound like garbage. This video does not mention if the lc3 codec was used. I'm guessing it wasn't because the support is still rolling out and Mac doesn't support it natively yet.

    ↳ @MikkoRantalainen  👍0  2025-05-16
    @poomunj If you honestly cannot have an arm for the mic (the correct solution in my opinion), you might have best results with beamforming from multiple microphones. And hopefully the beamforming is implemented with dedicated hardware instead of trying to offload it to drivers on the host system.

    @MikkoRantalainen Again, we're creating new chip architecture, made massive jumps in terms of GPU, literally created AI, but we can't have a better protocol set?

    @Atimoz Isn't it more precisely a question of codecs at this point? We have Bluetooth headphones that can receive LDAC which is 990 Kbps, so there must be a way to receive audio the quality of AAC at 320 Kbps max and emit the same quality for a mic at also 320 Kbps or slightly lower within the same bandwidth, right? Or am I missing something? Legit question btw, not tryna assume anything.

    This isn't the fault of the device, it's a fault of the bluetooth standard.  It has enough bandwidth to do pretty darn good audio one way, but really bad audio two way.  This is why some headphones actually have two different modes when you look at them in your computer's sound mixer, one "headphone" and one "headset", where the headset is garbage audio quality because it's half width.  The only thing that will fix this is for a bluetooth revision with more bandwidth to become the industry standard.

    @demivideos8887that is the reason, lemme tell you why thats the case.
I have airpods pro 2, their mic quality is okay to say the least, but when I am in discord or on calls where the sound has to be clear, what is do to drastically improve the sound is, cup my hand, put it in the direction of the AirPod which is using the mic, and voila, sounds (almost) like a pro mic. Try it and tell me.
The reason is, by cupping your hand you re direct the sound waves directly to your headphone’s/AirPod’s microphone.

    ↳ @levindeed  👍1  2025-06-22
    @yellowhouse88 not until all the VoIP apps rewrite their comms software to support it as well.

    Bluetooth is 31 years old.. which isn't even the reason for the bad quality. We have all kinds of crazy bandwith now for bluetooth..
..BUT.. the protocol for simultaneous communication and the often needs for compatibility always use like what feels like the lowest possible bandwith.. 
But it is mostly the intercompatibility.. iPhone with Airpods has great quality.. but airpods with pc for communication on things like discord are horrible.
What really grinds my gears is windows 11 not making it easy to just use the good audio quality of my airpods when any application is running that uses or tries to use the microphone.. on win10 you could just disable the "phone function" of the airpods easy.. on win 11 its quite the hassle..

    ​@aro-aro-aro I've had the XM4s since they came out almost 6 years, they're perfect for music but I haven't used them much for calls because people complained they couldn't hear me clearly (as opposed to my in-ears). Not sure how valid that is, but I just don't use them for that purpose (which has helped with reducing normal wear/tear as I only use them for music). That said, when it comes to music, they are unparalleled, absolutely stunning... will make you jump with joy or bring tears to your eyes (depending on your musical tastes) 😂... guaranteed!!

    ↳ @SweedRacer  👍0  2025-05-15

How can headphones at this price point still not have a DAC? Can't believe this wasn't discussed here. The Beats Pro Studio and AirPods Max have this feature. After all, they are headphones for music. You can't get anywhere near the audio quality without one. The only reason these are even better than the Beat Studio pro at all is ANC. Even then the ANC in the Beats is not bad by any means. IMO

    ↳ @shanksyac8826  👍1  2025-05-18
    ⁠​⁠@A4000When we’re critiquing the prices of these headphones and comparing them with each other to see which has more value for the price, your “hyperbole” doesn’t help determine that. 500 is a long shot from 300. Following your logic, If I ask the same question: “but is it 1000 bucks more?” I’m also being hyperbolic but also not contributing to if spending the extra cash is worth it for the latest product.

Nothing wooshed over my head; your comment simply didn’t help or rebuttal the other guys point about the XM6’s being more than 5% better. 👍

    ↳ @A4000  👍0  2025-05-18
    @shanksyac8826 “500 is a long shot from 300.” Yes, that’s what hyperbole is, an exaggeration for effect, with the point being does the performance/upgrades justify the difference in price. See, the actual price doesn’t matter, so even your $1000 more example would still work, because - does the performance justify the price- would still apply. If OP is correct about 95% similarity in performance (give or take) then it does not matter what the specific price is because even at half the price, it would not be worth 5% improvement. That’s how logic works, kid. 

It was never about the specific price, it’s about the ratio of money & value compared to the XM4. So, yeah, it whooshed over your head, too fast for you to catch it, Drax.

    ↳ @shanksyac8826  👍0  2025-05-24
    @A4000It was clear to me that you were exaggerating from the start. The point you’re missing with all this is that your sarcastic comment in the beginning didn’t contribute a single thing to the conversation. Or to the opposing point that this product doesn’t give as much value for price as the other one that was brought up. Ok, “kid”?

    ↳ @A4000  👍0  2025-05-24
    @shanksyac8826 so you’ll ignore my entire argument presented in my last post, without specifying how it’s logically flawed. Vagueness is the tool of little minds and weak arguments. If it was clear to you from the start, it wouldn’t take 3 posts for you to present a rebuttal, kid.

definitely hot on the ears after a couple of hours.... comtemplating keeping them vs trying something else that might be more comfortable over the long haul flights

So the ultimate question, do I upgrade from my xm4’s ?

I love my M5's! Still my favorite headphone. Not sure if that price difference is worth all the buzz.

I just want to block out voices, dogs barking lol from our home with next door. I watch YouTube a lot and the Sony M4 are useless if you're not listening to music.

Pretty much slightly better version of the Xm4s at double the price…

------------------------------------------------------------

[1094] @Puggles678  👍0  2025-05-26
The real-time ANC adjusting was what made me return the XM5s. Wearing glasses was not doable with them either, due to the tiny gap from ear to headphone, and every time I would move my head, lean over, chew or talk/sing they constantly adjusted and it was always adjusting something somewhere and it drove me absolutely insane and I could not stand them and was forced to return them for that specific reason. I read your description and wanted to ask anyway, do the new XM6s do this at all, whatsoever? I work in a very noisy environment that's constantly changing noises, and my XM4s work beautifully, and I was curious about these new ones.

Thanks.

To bad you didn't mentioned hinges. A design flaw that sony didn't take responsibility, and didn't want to repair.

Glad Sony is back on top, had my XM4s forever and still love them.  Also give that employee at 4:17 a raise, dude is working in OVERDRIVE!

Thanks for the video, but you skipped an important test: How the mics sound when you’re outdoors on a call and there’s wind.

Currently on the market for headphones and I came across this model in my search, I am looking for headphones that have Bluetooth capabilities to connect late at night for gaming offline and watching movies on my tv but also want a corded option to listen to music on vinyl. Would these be recommended? Any opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. ✌🏽❤️

my 4 and 5 broke at the cup swivel so I won't be bothering.

[1100] @libertarianneighbor  👍0  2025-05-18
My XM6's just arrived. They are not nearly as comfortable as my XM4's. There is a clamping sensation around your ears that is akin to someone cupping their hands and pressing them over your ears. The discomfort is the price of noise cancelling which is much much better. The sound is better but nothing you'll be blown away by. The call quality is much much better. 

I'm considering returning them based on comfort level. Also, I am wondering if my money might have been better spent on a pair of open backed earphones and just use my XM4's for airplane rides.

Design looks a lot like Sonos, and sound wise they would never be as good as Sennheiser

I remember I watched on 2022 September his video about MX5 saying - The best hands down and I went straight to the shop and purchased them! Really happy ever since! MX6 looks amazing but im happy with MX5.

The WH-1000XM6 looks stylish and cool. I have Ult Wear that deep bass is good for me. Sony always develop nice products. Keep up the great work.

Sony for the love of god, fix the naming, allow 5 devices + make it rotate the like the surface headphones...the gestures are awful, i hate this touch thing

How was using these with Apple devices?

    Equalizer, background music and cinema mode using the sound connect app. Sound and ANC are great.

I also like the somewhat changed shape of both the handle and the ears. My xm5 hurt the top of my head when i wear them for a prolonged amount of time so i now have so knitted cover on it.
