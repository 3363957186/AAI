原文：I dunno man… i returned these after about an hour of use. I tried them out on my sony a95L tv. I usually use my airpod pro 2.0. I was interested to see if i can find something better so i tried out the 1000xm6

I put on predator badlands and tested out the first fight scene. I tried the 1000xm6 first. Sounded like muffled TRASH. I toggled between the “cinema” setting and the “heavy” eq setting. On the heavy setting the movie sounded pretty good but still a slight muffled tomato can sound was present. I popped in my airpod pro 2.0s and those were immediately better… crisp clean sound. Clean base… no muffled tomato can sound.

I dont get all the good reviews on these… AND im a sony guy. Not worth the money. Get a pair of airpod pros (2.0 or 3.0). Cheaper, sound better, and more versatile. No brainer

原文：If they kept the XM4 design and had the same features as the XM6 I would think it’s the number 1 best designed headphones. But here we are. I hate the fact that XM5s don’t fold and XM6 can fold but it’s the same bulky design. I just bought the XM4’s as the quality and comfort is still top class

    原文：Idk I always felt that Sony makes it's products targeted more towards asia. Smaller head smaller ears. Hence it is more comfortable for Asians than the other parts of the world.
I ask quite a lot of people Asians too whether they face any issues with ear pain or shallow Ness of the xm6, but so far nobody complained about that. The things I hear more are maybe concerns for hinges and some like a more premium quality. There's also another bunch who is fine with plastic because it's lighter not as much pressure on the top of your head like the bose.

The noise cancelling barely makes a difference. I want the noise cancelling  to block out all the background noise but it barely makes a difference.

原文：I just grabbed the XM6 and now I have XM4 to compare to side by side. Foreshadowing, I have a BIG head, I max out all my headphones, including the Sennheiser 6XX. They sound different, I EQ-ed them both so not a hard comparison, but the XM6 is more precise and ever so more stable. Overall, the XM6 is an upgrade on all charts, except comfort. 1) they clamp harder, 2) the headband is making me reposition them back and forth slightly every one or two hours, 3) the maxed out sliders mean that they will "twist" more easily - imagine your headphones sitting symmetrically on your left and right ears, but these can twist (rotating in opposite directions), I would not immediately notice, but it can cause assymetric pressure (and thus wear/pain if I clamp my earlobe/helix) AND can cause noise/pressure leaks that do make L/R channels ever so different (and so infuriating after I started paying attention to this). To be fair, for 3) I now physically make sure they are rotated symmetrically and I have not noticed an issue during normal wearing where they would mispossition themselves. Also a small 4) - the new mic array and processor for ANC are doing a killer job at killing the more annoying high-pitched noise, I think the overall step up is by 2dB across the spectrum, but do a better job in the London underground and in coffee shops, ever so slightly. XM4 are already awesome in this regard, this is marginal and not a reason to upgrade!

I also had the opportunity to try out the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2nd Gen, just for an hour or so. First impression was that they do a better job at soundstage out of the box and the earcup/headband comfort is better. How the headband comfort would project into a couple hours I do not know. But they hide their weight better certainly. I was not able to A/B them yet. But I am contemplating if the sound/ANC is worth the comfort compared to the XM6.

    原文：Hey, I am thinking of buying XM6 or XM4 would you be kind to tell me difference in ANC? That is the main thing for me, is thet feuture that mach better in 6 that is worth 200 e more?

原文：Sony XM3s are still the better sounding Headphones it's has more bass then my XM4s and I've heard XM5. I figure the XM6 have the same sound as the 5s only difference between them is the added features every newer model. But sound wise XM3s bass hits harder and has a stronger build. I still have my XM3s with tape holding them together even though I have the XM4s and XM5s.

原文：Fit and comfort are everything to me. I currently have the whch 250s and I wear them as an overnight custodian running various types of equipment such as vacuum cleaners and propane powered burnishers which are quite loud but the one thing that bothered me was to fit in Comfort I too found that after wearing them for about an hour my ears became very painful and I had to take them off. I see that Sony has carried this fit forward and this is a no starter for me. So taking in consideration all these matters I would not spend the money for an upgrade. If Sony fixes their comfort issue I would definitely give them a thumbs up. But for me I will pass on an upgrade at this time.

原文：To the product manager: Sony please listen carefully, I just purchased the WH-1000XM6 headphone, the extender adjustment feels cheap and isn't intuitive or smooth when adjusting. I don't know why you're going backwards, the noise canceling has been reduced it's weaker than the predecessors. Sound quality is excellent and the EQ overall is excellent but you need to work on the extender adjustment and the noise canceling. And it is not comfortable to wear at all it puts way too much pressure on my head. In my opinion the WH-1000XM2/3/4 had the best adjustment method and the absolute best noise canceling system especially the XM4's, maybe it has to do with the on-ear versus the over ear cups. Also, was the most comfortable to wear and to personalize in terms of adjustment and comfort. From one Sr. Product Director to another, this is the best decision Sony can make. Unfortunately I'm returning the headphones back to Best Buy. Sony is a phenomenal brand and I don't want the word "cheap" or  "backwards" to be associated with the brand. I have so much respect for the brand. That's why I reached out.

Build and sound quality seems better than XM5 but returning due to connectivity issues.

    原文：​@RangerAmir comfort is probably true, but subjective. Design is subjective as well. The audio out of the box is indeed better, but you have way less eq options. So it depends on what you want to use it for. Bose doesnt have spatial audio on the same level as Sony. Lossless is not true, bot aren't completely lossless, which is only achieved with wired. Sony has a 3.5mm jack entry, which CAN give you lossless audio, which Bose does not have. Build quality is probably true due to Sony's hinges, but Bose looks cheaper (but again, subjective). Don't get me wrong, Bose headphones are good. But the parts where they differ is mostly preference in importance, and subjective...

    原文：@RangerAmir I don't know about that. I compared the two side by side. I did prefer the immersive sound of Bose, but opposite to what I thought BEFORE I walked into the store, the Sony's felt more comfortable for my specific head. The Bose felt like cheap plastic compared to these, and they made a cheap-hard plastic "crunchy" sound when I was feeling around for the buttons... the transparency controls were way easier to use on the Sony (by just cupping the hand). In the end, I was surprised about how cheap BOTH headphones feel for the price... Hardware quality both sets felt like they were 150-200. Very disappointed in quality-to-price ratio.

    原文：⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@shanew7361 Hate to say it (as loved the sound) but I fully agree; had to send them back along with my APM. Can’t trust Apple 🍏 as they’ll drop something new and shiny when you least expect and the headphones are too heavy & can’t EQ them just so for £500, despite almost perfect sound + user experience + quality materials! And whilst I was going to keep XM5’s (as that slightly punchier bass was sooo cool!) the build quality was absolute trash - reminded me of those cheap headphones with the all smudging - and what’s shocking is just as I was about to start packing them up I did a final listen (just for fun as liked the sound so much) and they actually had stopped working after 1 day testing (this was after being charged); I did a quick factory reset & got rid..! I’d read that they fail during use but experiencing it during testing was just shocking! it’s unbelievable that a brand like Sony would waste time developing new iterations of its XM line if this is what they’ve lowered their standards to… once again Trash! 🗑️ Really hope that APM gets a lighter version (maybe AIrPod Max Air) & customisable eq cause then there would be zero need to deal with awful plastic headphones that are blatant cash grabs for tech that doesn’t consistently deliver; what Sony is doing is actually worse than Apple because atleast Apple have a solid product; one Sony customer said that every XM he’s had has ended up breaking & after he spent $1200 on Sony he doesn’t have any devices to show for it, due to Sonys appalling customer service when XM’s breakdown 😮🎧

Sony has sadly trashed its brand. Jabra and FiiO have moved past Sony at far more reasonable price points. I was always ready to pay more for Sony because I thought I was purchasing a premium product.

原文：i had mine for about six months now and they have become unusable. I am a heavy listener, and listen while working and commuting and at home. My ear proximity sensor broke after a few months. Now the touch controls are glitchy AF, voice mode randomly turns on or off and on when i go outside into cold weather, and something is wrong with the right speaker now, the ANC blows up low frequencies. Similar things have happened to the previous versions I've had. The only thing that's still working well about these are the battery and the speakers themselves. Oh, also the app sucks, you can't manually set noise cancellation level (it's always adaptive, but sometimes I want to set it to max if I have to sleep in a place with infrequent noises so it's completely useless for that). I really don't get the positive reviews for this one but I'm giving up on Sony due to their low durability.

Better yet I’ll continue to use my Skull Candy Crushers for gym sessions and PX8 S2 for immersive soul hitting listening experiences. Returning these and repurchasing the PX8 S2. It’s worth every dollar. These are worth $299 max and that is mostly because of the software features.
