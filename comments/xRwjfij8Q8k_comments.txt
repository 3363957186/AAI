Ok seriously I’ve commented this before but where do you get the money for this stuff?? Are you renting it or smth?? There is no way with the views you’re getting that you are able to afford all this stuff

    ↳ @GOATplayzYT-670  👍2  2025-08-14
    I’ve been wanting to ask this for so long😭

    ↳ @GOATplayzYT-670  👍2  2025-08-14
    but i think maybe he has a deal with tech companies. Because when your atleast a popular enough creator (like bro he has over 200k subs and he’s monetized so he earns money) companies will send u free stuff so that while your reviewing it it in a way ADVERTIZES their product… hope this helps😊🤣

    job.

    ↳ @Autonomized06  👍1  2025-08-16
    Tech youtubers get sent review models by tech companies because its worth it to get their product out there. They dont pay for it. (But also they only get one model for each product so they dont get five free macbooks pros for each chip:)

When you buy a Mac you’re buying MacOS. I own both and Windows has the better value every time. I very much so like MacOS, it’s just too expensive for what’s in the computer.

As a retired Apple Supporter/SysAdmin, I bought a 15" M2 Air. for the price and (most importantly) what I do, it would have been wasted money for a Pro. 6 weeks ago, i did buy a use 16" 2019 Intel Pro - base model - which I bought mostly as a box for a sundowned music notation program I still need - It cost me all of $350. Last night on a lark, I used it watching ripped DVDs- Nice screen, nice speakers, not appreciably better than the M2 Air. But its real strength is as an office heater in the winter. HEAT!! So now in August, it's not really comfortable. The M2 however is at 45 degrees. No problems, even in the summer.

    ↳ @vee6580  👍1  2025-08-29
    What would you advise a junior devops engineer to go with?. I am currently using an intel macbook pro 2020. Would an upgraded macbook air with m4 chip suffice for virtualisation, docker etc or I should rather go for a 24GB RAM 512GB M4 pro chip macbook?.

Pros are for professional editors; Air will do most nicely — and way more affordable!

I would get the Pro, I prefer functionality over anything!

    ↳ @FooksTechnology  👍5  2025-08-15
    ​​​@cptsi-z5s I would much prefer a windows laptop. But this video is not about that. It's about Macbooks. My thought process was I'm willing to pay for the extra performance, I do not care about form as much (lightweight, thin, etc). Especially since the Pros get great battery life which battery life and portability is literally the main purpose/selling point of a MacBook. Windows on ARM has not caught up yet. If you want a  great fast laptop that has extremely good battery life and screens you get a MacBook. If you want way better performance but not as good battery life you get a Windows laptop. The Windows side has not caught up to the same performance and battery life ratio that MacBooks have because, let's face it, Windows on ARM is not all the way there yet. Hopefully in the next few years there's more competition.

------------------------------------------------------------

[19] @Eric-m5x  👍0  2025-08-19
If ur trying to go for a low budget but not too low of a price definitely go for a Mac book air but if your the type of person who stays up and works over time or has to do a lot of homework and you have a pretty high budget I’d say go for the pro with the m4 chip max

I currently have and still use my MacBook Pro (mid 2014 model) so it’s a good 11 years old. I want to upgrade but not sure if I need the pro or if the air will do just fine. I want it to last 11 years like my current MacBook. I edit raw files in Lightroom and photoshop from photo shoots, I open multi web browsers at once, check emails, and create charts in google sheets and that’s about it and I usually have my screen brightness up as much as it allows for because my eyes are not the best. I do edit an occasional video here and there but nothing extreme. 😅 which do you prefer?

------------------------------------------------------------

[23] @KiraWrath  👍96  2025-10-05
Pretty much everyone who buys a pro will never have a workload heavy enough in which a Mac air wouldn’t handle just as well.

    ↳ @banyohavlusu2383  👍8  2025-12-13
    Okay that’s maybe a bit going too far but yeah I agree at least 50% of pro users are just fine with the air. But me personally I do a lot of heavy coding/simulations so I went w the 13” m2 macbook pro, even though the 14” m2 pro is obviously much better it was out of my budget

    ↳ @BladeBrown-o9x  👍8  2025-12-20

Guys, so here's a tutorial on how long your battery will last 
So you get the battery life Apple says, and half it 4 times

------------------------------------------------------------

[30] @jacobravanal1184  👍0  2025-09-04
the biggest thing is the fan. apple tries to make a design without fans. the result is no sustained performance. it works as well as an iPhone or iPad would do, it’s just running macos. now why on earth would you get a macos device that can’t even perform sustained loads? isn’t that the point you get a mac because the software is more powerful than iOS? yeah i don’t get apples logic here. no one should buy the macbook air. go buy an iPad with M series chip or a Macbook Pro. there’s no in between.

Pro models are designed for demanding tasks such as video editing, managing multiple tabs, and multitasking efficiently. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, is sufficient for other general uses. I got the Air and my work are light office task and  designs its more than enough.

    @shiekhwaleedmiral-protein2819cause base model is little but kinda underpriced, it is entry level laptop to lure you into the apple world and later you will buy higher model so they get money back, flagship models are really obepriced, they sell less of them but they get hugh margin, most people buy something in the middle, reallly clever pricing model

    ↳ @halkonxTV  👍0  2025-09-12
    @RosaPercs-b6d the problem is that people don't use it. when people hear linux, they think of no gaming, no support, and a pretty bad community, but actually using linux is very fun. i can do so many things and if more people used it, there would be a better community, and more support from big companies. for me, arch is less buggy than windows 11.

    ​@halkonxTVtried linux. You really have to be windows hater or have old pc to use linux. Every program opens so slowly, most of the application I use doesn't exist at all. Keep having issues with drivers and general 2010 design is not pleasant to use anymore. I know there are better ui and customasibility, but most of it feels so old and amateur. Windows just works if you spend 20 mins ones to customize it and sometimes ask chat to fix somethink. Linux is just old car which you have to service every week and does nothing but drive slowly.

    ⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@Fasdfeidk what distro you used, but linux is way faster than windows. You definitely used a distro that already has a Desktop Environment, but the thing about linux is that you can install custom desktop environments, that can either look old, or as new as they can.

I use a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4, and my wife uses a 13-inch MacBook Air with M4. From my experience, it is simply not comfortable to work long hours on any laptop screen without an external display. The posture is bad by default. You sit hunched, head and shoulders tilted down, and that takes a toll quickly.

Once you add a proper external display, the advantage of the MacBook Pro screen mostly disappears. At that point, the built-in display becomes secondary, so paying extra for a Pro just for the screen makes little sense.

Performance-wise, the M4 MacBook Air easily handles every realistic task I can think of. For the vast majority of users, it is more than powerful enough.

That is why the 13-inch Air is the sweet spot. It is extremely portable, noticeably more affordable, and very versatile for work-life balance. You can work all day connected to an external display, work on the go when needed, or just lie on the sofa and relax. It does all of that without compromise.

    I'd honestly consider the bigger size. I bought an M4 Air 13" but the screen is so tiny I wish I'd gone for the 15".

MacBook Air if all you need is the base chip, Mac Mini if you want the M4 Pro, MacBook Studio for the Max chip =/

BS aside, MacBook Pro if you want the Pro or Max.

Don’t get the base chip MacBook Pro. It’s not worth it. I say M4 MBA >>>> M5 MBP.

When MBP was M4 or when MBA is eventually M5, all the more reason to get MBA when base chip is concerned.

    Their base models perform the exact same because they have the same chip, only difference in the base is the pro has active cooling

iPad Air can do whatever you want. This includes gaming and video editing. My M2 still holds up strong when I'm video editing or streaming games. It only slightly gets hot and battery starts to drain only by a smaller speed. It's an overall great laptop for it's price.

Hey everyone.
My 2019 Macbook Pro 13" 128go intel just died past month, and I have to buy a new Mac for the new year in university for the beginning of september.

Knowing my utilisation and my last Macbook Pro, my priorities are to upgrade of course the RAM if possible to 512go cause 256go seams a bit thick knowing I have just totally filled my 128go, and also get a screen bigger cause 13" was a bit too small.

Knowing that, my first thought was to buy a Macbook Air M4 15" with 512go. But I have seen that the Macbook Pro M4  14" 512go is just 150/200€ of more, so I wonder if it’s not better to put 150€ more to have the better screen, the connectors (micro SD, HDMI etc (I am gonna use it a lot)), the better battery, and others things like the better sono, the cooler so more power for long asks, etc…

My only fear is that I have seen them in store and the difference between the 14" and the 13" is not that big, so I clearly would buy the 16" but it can’t come with M4, and it’s clearly not reasonable to buy the 16" M4 pro for my utilisation cause the price up for 1700€ to 2600 (NB it’s in € cause I am french and I have the students price, that’s why it’s a bit less expensive than the normal).

So to resume, I am hesitating between :
- buy a Macbook Pro M4 14" 512go (1700€)
- or be more reasonable and buy a Macbook Air M4 15" with 256go and I buy an external SSD with 1to for exemple (cause it’s make me a bit mad to buy an Air for 1500€ when the Pro is just 200€ more)…

Do you have some advice or feedbacks for me about this two computers ?

    ↳ @SOSULLI  👍2  2025-09-05
    I'm guessing you confused a few things. That RAM doesn't exist and you mean gb right?

The thing mainly is, how apple scams people, the macbook air is so cheap, but everyone gets tempted to at least go from 8 to 16gb RAM. Also definitely a 512GB SSD. Then you're at the price of a pro obviously. 
And with a base Pro you're not really tempted to upgrade RAM to lets say 64GB, useless.
Or get a 2TB SSD etc. 
So I would say, look at the screens, which do you prefer. Then either go for a definitely good for money Air with basic specs, but don't get tempted to upgrade a few things. And with the macbook pro, definitely don't go above $2000,-
The people that choose macbook pro's for 2500-3500 never ask anyone the question which laptop to choose as they know what they require for their heavy graphical work.

    ↳ @raphael4783  👍0  2025-09-05
    ⁠​⁠​⁠@SOSULLIyes I said RAM cause it’s about the same thing.
and the « RAM » is automatically at 16go minimum on the Macbook Air M4.

and in the end I choose the Air M4 15" with 512go in clear blue, and I really like it, so glad I choose it. and the gap between my 2019 Pro 13" 8go/128go i5 and this is juste amazing.

    ↳ @SOSULLI  👍0  2025-09-05
    @raphael4783 Not sure what you mean. You referred to RAM as being "512go". 

I'm guessing you mean SSD and gb instead of go.

SSD is your hard-drive and RAM is your working memory. So one can get up to 4TB and the other is often 8-64GB.

    ↳ @raphael4783  👍0  2025-09-05
    @SOSULLIno I was reffering to SSD saying 512go.
It’s juste that I wrote « go » instead of « gb », that’s it. 
And I write RAM cause it’s easier than « unified memory ».

Absolutely nothing in this price range comes close to it. And before the neckbeards come out, yes gaming laptops beat it in gaming but why the hell would you get a macbook if youre gaming?

Pro has superior sound speakers and powerful than air.5) why i bought MacBook Air as my personal laptop? Because 1000€ is my max budget, i need a light weight to carry,i compared mac book air with other brands not with pro.MacBook Air is definitely superior that any any brand of this price range .
