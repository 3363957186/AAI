The word BARGAIN is the crux of this argument. Bargain for who is the better question? Yes, Dell's new XPS line is way overpriced at the moment, but the vast majority of users aren't running local AI applications or editing large video projects. For most people, these laptops are far from a bargain.

You didn’t mention much about the Ram?

    ↳ @cameron_bosch  👍1  2026-02-15
    Yeah, upgrading Macs, because you are forced to do so at purchase, even for the SSD, is way too expensive, and reason enough for me not to use them.

I don't want appliances, I want tools. And generally, I can work on tools.

    @cameron_bosch The advantages of on-chip RAM easily outweigh the disadvantages of being non-upgradeable. Just get what you need and wait for deals; you can get the upgrade at a reasonable price.

So..... Would this mean -- that if you do trade in, for upgrades -- that you get more for the trade in price, to the point where companies pays you to upgrade & own it ??????

I need to upgrade from my M2 Pro MBP. I went out and got a new M4 Pro MBP and my job finally upgraded my old M1 MBA 2 days later. LOL now I have a MBP that I’m not using as much because I was using it for work. I have no issues with MacOS 26 at all. I’m sorry for the ones who have issues with it.

Considering I spent $2000 on lenovo legion 5i and got a macbook pro m5 from work that is worth $1500 and handles the same workload and have hourss long battery

Comparing a passively cooled MacBook Air M4 to the actively cooled MacBook Pro M5 seems quite „sneaky“, I mean, misleading.

------------------------------------------------------------

[9] @saturnotaku  👍0  2026-02-16
I got a base M5 MBP for $1349 brand new over the holidays. At that price, I think it's worth it. That said, the outgoing entry-level M4 Pro model is regularly being discounted to $1750-1800, which makes it a stronger value than the M5 at $1599 since you're getting better GPU performance, 24 GB of unified memory, and a laptop that is quieter under load because of its dual-fan cooling solution.

MacOS Tahoe and iOS 26 both sucks. Lots of gimmicks like transparent glass look, unnecessary bloat, bugs, UI clutter (like adding 4 steps to something that used to take 1 step) and worst of all, it drains battery way faster than what it should. I hate the latest operating systems. Wtf are apple doing ??

As a tech enthusiast, I don't settle for base models because every time I come up with demanding use case scenarios, I never feel like I have enough performance. Even when I have high end hardware, I always find ways to push it to its limits regardless if it's intentional or not.

    Nothing even close to being as bad as Windows 11. I just updated iPadOS 26 on my iPad mini and I was pleasantly surprised to see three of my biggest gripes and bugs fixed. No doubt if there's any issues on the macOS they're being addressed. I don't use the liquid glass nonsense look.

The RAM is the issue, most non apple laptops at this price are coming with 32GB of Ram and usualy 1TB of storage.

    ↳ @Doctor_Technopolis  👍0  2026-02-15
    Yeah but they're 27% less RAM efficient in storage and even less so in memory bandwidth, and the users are typically not using all that either, so it's much more of a mixed bag comparison of pros and cons than you make it sound.

Hilariously when M1 came out then M2 everything was seemingly so overpriced it was insane and each upgrade hurt. Never did i think in only a few years the prices barely shift but everything else raises to that level to the point where we are now. Its actually wild.

[24] @HanniVlad  👍0  2026-02-16
It's kinda funny to notice Apple's popular price policy, also thanks to a clever RAM chip deal that's keeping prices unusually low – while everybody used to talk about "Apple tax" on RAM…
This M5 is a real powerhouse, at the point I'd like to stick the M5 logo by BMW on the cover 😁

Seems pedantic maybe but id trust a M1 MBP to M5 MBP comparison more than a M1 Macbook Air  to M5 Macbook pro

    ↳ @Thiccolo  👍3  2026-02-15
    the performance is effectively the same.

    ↳ @teish.  👍4  2026-02-15
    Then the chips won't be equal this is base M5 vs base M1. There is no M5 Air and there is no M5 Pro chip yet.

    ↳ @aCayden  👍12  2026-02-15
    @Thiccolo No. Macbook Pro has M1 Pro vs M1 in the air. Faster chip, more cores, higher clock, more ram, higher memory width, better cooled, etc. M1 pro is a much better bargin.

    ↳ @JustPlayitc00l  👍12  2026-02-15
    Was about to say the same thing... The Airs have horrible cooling compared to the Pros. Even with the same specs, the Pro would always beat the Air

    ↳ @Tyler_Durden_99  👍4  2026-02-15
    @Thiccolobut it’s not always because of thermals

    ↳ @im.Gerard  👍8  2026-02-15
    @aCayden There was an M1 MBP variant. It was an older MBP chassis, but it contained an M1 (non-Pro) chip. This was around when M1 was very new.

    ↳ @WatcherKoops4677  👍1  2026-02-15
    Thought about getting a used M1 or 2 MacBook... But it's gotta be Air for budget reasons

    ↳ @alexct3912  👍1  2026-02-15
    The test subjects should not be compared in such a way. If the test was done properly it would have been all base 14inch pros. This video shows difference sized pros (16,14), cross generation chips that are different tier (m4 pro, m5 base) and then you just set a baseline using airs? It makes no sense.

    ↳ @chidorirasenganz  👍1  2026-02-15
    @alexct3912there was no m1 or m2 14in only Pro level chips

    ↳ @or1on89  👍0  2026-02-16
    @im.Gerard And performed exactly the same as the Air. I anything M5 is the first tgeneration where you can use the baseline M-chip in a more production oriented chassis that is not a refuse on the lineup. The performance in these benchmarks won't change, the generational improvements are the same...sustained work is a different story but you can't buy a new M1 these days anyway...

The MacBook Air packages get less power than the pros. Saying that the m5 is getting double the power than the m4 and that’s why it’s so much better is stupid. You should have used an m4 MacBook Pro for actual real differences where you would see that they use similar power levels, with the m5 using just a bit more not double

------------------------------------------------------------

[27] @Renbits  👍0  2026-02-17
wish u had mentioned that it's not a good time to buy a new mac, since the m5 pro/max are around the corner (even if someone only wants a base m5, there will probably be used market deals on them), not to mention the m6 with oled in september

------------------------------------------------------------

[28] @Marko-nx9eq  👍0  2026-02-15
Close but not yet imho.  If you run macOS only after reboot, 15 GB RAM is eaten (don't forget that is ram is shared) so 32 GB is bare minimum. 512 GB for 2026 and media producers is big joke. If you want upgrade, you must buy new. OLED display, 2TB  SSD and 32GB  RAM for that price is ok.

    ↳ @TalesOfWar  👍0  2026-02-15
    I guess you don't understand how modern OS's use memory. It'll use whatever it has available. If you have 1TB it'll look for as much to use it for as it can. Why have so much if you're not going to make use of it?

Today, it seems that running local LLMs is more of a way to validate computer prices than for real value. Nobody runs a local LLM for serious work, not when you can use a state-of-the-art model for $20 a month. If you want a truly useful local LLM, you'll probably have to spend MUCH more than that.

For all the folks complaining that macOS can't game.. Codeweavers has came a long way with their work on WINE. Crossover (the commercial version of wine for macOS and Linux) can run almost every game that the SteamDeck can, except for the 2-3 games that are patched for anticheat. Plus, the M5 is over 100% faster.

Whey did this seem like an extended commercial for the M5 MBP?  Most M2-M4 Air users will never push their laptops to those extreme multi-core CPU performance levels.  The M2 Air single core CPU performance is still excellent to this very day. 

The only rational reasons to get the M5 MBP from that audience (MacBook Air crowd) is for the extra ports, better display, better screen refresh rate, and to play the new games available for MacOS.

    ↳ @TalesOfWar  👍1  2026-02-15
    The "only reasons" you describe are very compelling reasons to upgrade as they're tangible improvements to your actual physical use of the device.

    ↳ @akin242002  👍0  2026-02-15
    ​@lordv1le859The battery life on the M2 to M4 Air were already excellent and exceeding 10 hours in regular use. 

The speakers were good too.  Thus, not much of an upgrade except the categories I mentioned.  One could legitimately argue the upgrade from the M1 Air is overdue.  Especially for those on 8 GB of RAM.

    Yes.. While I appreciate the work involved, comparing the M5 (which has a fan) with the rest of the Airs makes little sense performance wise, and hits different audiences/buyers.

Let alone the fact that you can get an M4 Air for half the price of the M5 and use it for the next 10 years. That's the equivalent of $7 a month, less over time due to inflation, that will help you make money. Little productivity monsters.

what made the m1 so great is listed right on the score. its power usage. its very low power usage with the performance. what i am seeing is that yes double the performance but at a greater than 3x the power usage. assuming the watt number is the power usage. so the question is did apple manage to get the fan noise back down to m1 levels with the m5s?

    @CorneliusTaylor-s1u in expensive? Maybe if you can get a stick for 200$, the same should not cost 1000$ elsewhere? If a laptop can come premium at 1600 and have 32GB Ram then I dont see why a 1800$ laptop should come with 16. Buy by all means go ahead and spend 2000$ on a 16GB so your laptop can last 2 hours more while watching youtube in school.

    I suspect 95% of users buy what they need, so upgradeability is a niche feature. More important is quality, efficiency, noise, performance, etc. Anyone buying a laptop for upgradeability is probably buying a lesser device, just in case they need more RAM in the future — buy what you need.

    ↳ @AndrewTSq  👍2  2026-02-15
    @aCayden that is cause you are using Windows. Apples cpus now have a hardware compressor for ram, so it will compress apps that is not needed in realtime in memory.. and decompress it in realtime when you tab to it again. This makes the M4 i have feel like it has more like 20GB of ram than 16GB.  With all apps running that i usually use, I use around 11GB ram, meanwhile my Linux computer uses slightly less with same apps.. and Windows 11 when I used to use that.. was like 9GB just booting up lol.. not to talk about VRAM.. Linux 250MB vram after booting, 15.7 free.. Windows 11 you will be happy if it only uses 1.5GB Vram after start

    ↳ @JustSomeDude31  👍3  2026-02-15
    MacBook air but not the pro is around that price here, the pro with 32gb ram is about 2800.

    @firasrabaia what is serious productivity? I use my Mac M4 air for music production, and i also do 3d modelling in blender. No problems at all with 16GB vram. But the M4 has a way better hardware memory compression than the M1 Pro has, since the M4 also features Dynamic Caching and ARMv9 instructions which has optimisations for this. So my 16GB feels more like 20GB. On my Linux desktop I have 64GB ram, but I never run out of it with the apps I use.

    ↳ @cameron_bosch  👍1  2026-02-15
    ​@aCaydenCAD has no software for macOS. It's literally Windows only. And it relies heavily on CUDA, so modern Apple Silicon Macs are basically DOA in that industry.

And of course, you're locked into macOS on those Macs.

    ↳ @cameron_bosch  👍1  2026-02-15
    ​@AndrewTSqthis is blatantly untrue. Max Tech, the tech brother duo who started their tech career at AppleInsider, were one such channel that literally noted it was similar to Windows in that regard. Both need around 4 - 5 GB of RAM at idle from a cold boot.

Meanwhile, I can literally run a full Linux distro with less than 3 GB of RAM with something like LXQt or Xfce, and it will work fine. Obviously, more RAM helps, but swap isn't used nearly as often there.

And keep in mind that constantly using swap space will burn through read/write cycles on the SSD. Nearly every Windows device has it replaceable. Macs? Only the desktops do, and not the MacBooks. That literally means you're left with a brick once those are exhausted, as now you'll need a soldering kit.

    ​@cameron_bosch "need" is where the slip happens. Apple Silicon dynamic caches loads a lot of stuff it DOES NOT NEED and is OPTIONAL in order to get massive speed efficiency. Unused RAM is wasted RAM, so by anticipating and preloading the memory you're most likely to use, performance is accelerated. If you take a 8GB Mac and a 16GB Mac and a 24GB Mac and load the same three programs, you'll notice the 16GB "uses" more than the 8GB, and the 24GB Mac "uses" more than the 16GB. Do not confuse this with "need". In general the statement that a Mac only needs half the RAM as Windows is an exaggeration in most cases. In same software testing I found it's not a scalar like 2x, but rather, a function more like 1.19x + 1.31GB. For a 16GB Mac that's roughly equivalent to (1.19)*16=19.04 + 1.31GB = 20.35GB. 20.35/16=1.272. Far from 2x, but +27% better memory efficiency is nothing to sneeze at.

    ↳ @Doctor_Technopolis  👍0  2026-02-15
    @cameron_bosch There's no such thing as "Windows only" since you can run Windows programs on Mac, often with better performance, right inside a macOS window (via Parallels). It's true there is "Mac only" but that's actually an advantage in software for Mac, since it can run both but Windows can't. 

"Of course you're locked into macOS on those Macs" -- no, it's the only computer that can run all 3 major operating systems: Windows (for ARM), macOS, and Linux.

    @CarlSnub 1. It's not a VM. It's a hypervisor; think of it as ALMOST running bare metal Windows on ARM. 2. The answer to your question comes down to CPU performance. Top tier CPU's on Windows machines are roughly equivalent to the M3 chip or in other words two years behind Apple Silicon BASE MODEL chips. Most Windows machines are NOT running top tier CPU but something even farther behind. So yes, under a typical scenario, it scores better than Windows on bare metal. Can you get a Windows machine with Threadripper and RTX 5090 and compare it to a 6 year old M1 Mac and easily outperform the Mac running Windows? Yes. But on even terms (say cost), the Mac running Windows outperforms the PC running Windows.

    @cameron_bosch Incorrect. I'm commenting to you now from Windows on Mac. With an official Microsoft License.
If running Linux as the boot OS, it's not that the support is bad, it's that your distro is limited to one that can take advantage of all the Ferrari-like hardware under the hood. But it's Arch-based, by the way, so no problems there, you can literally turn that into anything you want.
In the a world where Mac is best at everything EXCEPT (1) headless Linux server development, AND (2) Running rare niche software that's only available to Windows, the answer SHOULD be obvious except where one faces one's own ignorance.
macOS for everything except headless Linux server dev (which you run in container/VM), and Parallels outperforming Windows at Windows software, inside macOS.
There's simply nothing you can argue about it, Mac covers all three and nothing else does.
Now then, in a world where the main use case of the PC is hosting an RTX 5090 for gaming, that's the only world where you can MAYBE argue for the PC, and only then depending on what games you play and how resource intensive they are. I'd argue if you're not a 240fps pro-gamer making a living off tournament money, Mac is still the better choice even in that world.

Hit up their forums, it runs like garbage when it runs and that is on a SnapDragon chip designed to run Windows on ARM, not a VM on a Macbook.  The Snapdragon/Windows on ARM laptop does not have that VM layer to work through and it still does not run good.

    @Doctor_Technopolis My day job is IT infrastructure and I run a huge VMware environment.  We have Hyper V and XCP-NG as well.   By the way I have a M4 Macbook Pro 16inch and a Mac Mini M2 Pro, along with various Windows machines, and a Thinkpad with Fedora on it.

The "HyperVisor" is the layer that VM's run on.  It controls access to hardware.  Parallels is a Hypervisor, type 2 that sits on top of MacOS.  VS a type one, like ESXi or Hyper V that are type 1, and the host OS is just another VM, sometimes called the control VM.  Type 1 Hypervisors are closer to the metal and faster than type 2.  They are also way more stable, since the host OS VM could crash and the other VM's keep running.  If the host OS crashed on a type 2 hypervisor, it all comes down.

Windows on ARM emulates Windows x86/64 apps when they are not ported natively to ARM for Windows.  So AutoCad 2025 is a x86/64.  If you try to run it on Windows on ARM, any call to the OS/Hardware that is made in code for a x86/64bit processor will be translated to the Windows on ARM equivalent.  The App sees an emulated version of Windows x86/64.  If that emulation is not perfect, you get issues.  Also that process slows it down and you do not get native performance.

So if you want to run AutoCad 2025 on on MacOS, you fire up MacOS, the HOST OS, then you startup Parallels, they TYPE 2 hypervisor, then you start Windows on ARM VM, then load up Autocad for x86/64 which is being emulated to run on Windows on ARM.  That is a A LOT of layers to go through and possible break points.

Biggest issue I see being a music producer is that Logic Pro doesn't use efficiency cores... Only Performance Cores.  Ironically the M5 in the Macbook Pro only has 4 Performance Cores.  Exact same as the M1.  I have a Mac Mini M1 with 16gb that I use in the studio and until they increase the core count on the M5, I'll just stick with that.  It's not enough of a performance boost to justify the cost.  The only options that would give me a good performance boost would be the M4 Pro or Max but really don't want to upgrade to something already being replaced.  I do want to replace it with a Macbook Pro, but will wait until the M5 Pro or Max or whatever they end up calling it is out.

I'm thinking of Mac mini just for image and video editing. At the moment windows 11 is a mess because it starts updating in the background when I've paused it with Pro license. Most of the CPU is spent on updates rather than work and after updating there's lot of micro srutters with switchable graphics and I've to connect external display

    ↳ @DrAliToma  👍1  2026-02-15
    What CPU is being used by background updates? If you have a modern CPU, it typically has low-power cores or efficiency cores just for background tasks (Intel). AMD CPUs can usually brute-force their way through these tasks. Why are you editing using a CPU anyway? What's the GPU doing?

    @DrAliToma  Its a thinkpad p14s with AMD Ryzen 8840HS with eGPU 4070 Super. Performance was very good with Win 11 22h2/23h2 until upgrading and clean installing to 24/25H2 garbage release. Its the seventh time reinstalling everything and loss of time. The old windows 10 PC with 6700HQ and 980M 8G can still hold up its own on premiere but resolve free 19/20 made it unusable so made me upgrade.
On Linux, its better but managing nvi driver after every kernel upgrade is a mess.
I simply switched from Resolve to Premiere Elements because its a stutter fest in edit page and exporting it caused massive memory leaks even on latest version.
That NPU and all the AI features are causing major hiccups and AMD drivers for NPU choke the system if there's constant heavy memory and IO involved throwing a dxgi error. The drivers and firmware are pathetic for a band aid Windows 11 as a 25+ year windows user as a kid.

Hopefully we see the availability of Panther Lake laptops increase. Currently, the only model available in Australia is the MSI Prestige 16 Flip AI+ 16 with the Ultra 9 386H, 32GB RAM and a 2 TB SSD which is $850 AUD more than the cheapest M5 MacBook Pro (with the education discount). 

That said, x86 is still more appealing to me at this time. When Apple eventually drops support, you basically have a brick. With an x86 based laptop, you have SO many alternatives that you could easily run this for a decade or more if you really wanted to, and you aren't locked into a single OS. Plus no compatibility issues, even if this is increasingly becoming less of a concern on ARM based laptops as time progresses.

    ↳ @andyH_England  👍0  2026-02-16
    Apple does not upgrade the OS after 6-7 years, but you still receive security updates, and most apps continue to work. I have a 12-year-old MB Pro (backup) that works well for my needs.

Apple’s leaving money on the table with gaming. If they actually committed, they’d make way more. One smart move would be letting something like SteamOS run nativelythe way Boot Camp let people run Windows.

If games could run at native screen resolution, hit a stable 120fps, and support ray/path tracing, Macs would be insanely good for story-driven games. For competitive online titles, you could always dial back ray tracing to prioritize performance and latency.

But the bigger issue is focus: they need to land the blockbuster games GTA, Call of Duty, Battlefield, FIFA, F1, Red Dead, and the rest rather than mostly leaning on smaller indie titles. That’s how you make Mac a real gaming platform, not just “capable… technically.

“MacOS Tahoe looks awful” is subjective. Sequoia feels outdated, but you can tweak Tahoe settings to make it look like Sequoia, except fresher. It’s wrong to criticize the entire OS as awful when a few settings changes suffice. If you’re interested in discussing stability and pointing out frequent bugs, that’s a valid discussion.

    ​@Atulya_Chaudharythat's false. 16GB is 16GB. All the CPUs have dynamic usage which isn't unique to Apple. Once you exceed 16GB, the SSD is used to help. Using the SSD for RAM tasks is a way to degrade it faster. All SSDs have a limited amount of writes and eventually, they will fail. Especially a problem on devices that have them soldered on. Another problem Apple has is the new Glass interface. That's not optimized, that actually uses more RAM, CPU usage, and battery. It's a quiet way to hurt older devices and make people want to upgrade sooner.

    ​@adorkuareat that price, you can at least get a Windows computer capable of high end gaming. Intel and AMD CPUs are actually getting so good, that you don't need a dedicated GPU for moderate gaming. So if you are into older games, lighter games, or modern gaming with settings turned down, it's all possible. Windows has it's faults, but at least you can strip everything you don't want out of the OS.

    ​@itchysundaecan you open 5 instances of blender with a project running on your windows? That's what I meant by optimizations.. windows takes like 4-8gb(sometimes) of ram to run by itself.. and the "liquid glass is to slow old devices" is true, but only true for devices as old as the intel ones, and yes they do want people to move away from Intel macbooks considering they just got their last major update, I do agree with your point that liquid glass slows the device down, but you can turn that off.. and no 16gb is not 16gb, 16gb of unified memory is way better than 16gb of any ddr5 ram

    ​@Atulya_ChaudharyIntel, AMD, and Apple all have CPUs with RAM on die. M-Series use LPDDR4 or LPDDR5. Again, 16GB is 16GB. When you go over that, all computers will move it to swap memory on the SSD. It's as seamless on Mac as it is on Windows or Linux. Only difference is Windows or Linux can have faster or slower SSDs because they can have removable storage and different tiers of hardware. It's like how PS5s storage was supposed to be revolutionary and now it's outdated, but people still cling to that MARKETING fact.

My biggest problem is that when it comes right down to it, Apple's optional pricing is borderline CRIMINAL - and this was BEFORE the current DRAM-ageddon crisis; I can only imagine what it's going to be with prices spiraling out of control. Anything above 512GB of storage is insane compared to what you would be able to get for typical PC laptops - if you could even replace it, thanks to it being soldered on the board now. This goes all the way back to the days when you could still upgrade the memory yourself with off the shelf SO-DIMM's. My 2007 MacBook Pro was such a case. It came with 2GB of RAM, and the 4GB upgrade was $200, IIRC. I ended up looking for the same spec memory on Newegg (PC2 5300) and got the 2x2GB memory modules for $100 ( if it supported more than 4GB, I would have gladly gotten it). After my warranty expired, I also ended up replacing the HDD (it was a standard 2.5" mechanical drive back then), which unlike the memory, was not "user serviceable". This basically meant that you were opening parts of the laptop that normal people weren't supposed to touch.

Anyway, if involved  removing the keyboard panel with 8 tiny screws around the edges of the laptop, carefully lifting it to disconnect the thin ribbon cable, then pulling out the small isolated shell that contained the hard drive. I ended up replacing the included 200GB HDD with a 512GB model, where I was able to dual boot it with Windows 7 via Boot Camp. Total cost? Roughly half of the price of the 320GB upgrade.

I got a refurbished Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9 model two years ago with 32GB of memory and 236GB NVMe drive that I replaced with a 2TB model for about $130. The only thing I sacrificed was getting the faster of the two i5 processors over one of the available i7's, but I honestly can't tell over the X1 that I used for work prior to that; it still runs like a champ. Not bad considering I paid $500 plus the $130 for the larger drive.

BTW, if you really want to see what's more expensive, configure that MAcBook Pro with the same 32GB of memory and 1TB of drive space, then let's talk - I won't be surprised if that MacBook is $2,500+, making that Dell XPS seem like "the bargain".

    Apple stated that their current contract is fixed, so the new Macs will still be at the older price. Their RAM supplier's contract expires at the end of the year, so next year may be more expensive. However, for the M5, Apple can maintain these prices and maintain a distinct advantage.

    ↳ @Marko-nx9eq  👍2  2026-02-15
    @brandonw1604 They usually give you about three years of full support and maybe two more for security updates. But in my experience, even hitting that three‑year mark was rough and full of problems. Developing for macOS makes it worse—updates often break or slow down your existing code, so you end up fixing things constantly instead of moving forward. And when the software is expensive, rolling back isn’t really an option with the same team, which means you’re stuck paying for costly repairs and upgrades.

    ↳ @Marko-nx9eq  👍3  2026-02-15
    @AbhishekVaid On Windows, backward compatibility is almost a badge of honor. You can still run drivers or apps that officially “expired” years ago, and they’ll usually work fine. That’s why you can get away with using 2012 drivers on Windows 12 without issues. Microsoft bends over backwards to keep old stuff running, even if it’s clunky.
Apple takes the opposite route. When you jumped from Mojave to Catalina, all 32‑bit apps were instantly dead. No workaround, no fallback. And then with the ARM transition, tons of Intel‑based software broke or slowed down, even with Rosetta 2 trying to bridge the gap. Apple basically forces you to move forward, whether you’re ready or not.

    ​@PrivateSharing-p2k Apple killing 32bit is what allowed them to have such a seamless transition from Intel, as the x64 architecture is far closer and easier to translate/emulate/virtualise with ARM64 than x64 was. Even now, x86 is only technically supported on Windows because even modern CPU's have physical x86 hardware in them, which is one of the things that makes them more power hungry than ARM for example. Windows for ARM has the same x86 doesn't work here "problem" that Macs do for the same reasons. It has to be emulated, it isn't native.

Right now I’m testing a MacBook Pro 4 Max, and it’s been fine so far… except macOS Tahoe. The UI/UX is just terrible, and honestly that’s the main reason I still end up buying “dust” instead.

Why would you need to be installing other operating systems?

As for your repairability comments, that's a crock of crap. There are many things repairable on Macs. Maybe you're not capable of doing it.

    I have a 32gb 1tb and I’m not sorry. I think it’s overpriced but compared it still beats the alternative foe what I want the max for. I have a pc and I will always be a dual user from here on out but nothing beats a Mac. Now with the Ai scam and price gauging it’s more of a deal.

Cuz what is this about 

And what I mean to say is the ram and storage upgrade costs aren't the same in each and every country 
God knows why that is but yes it's not same across all countries

2tb 32gif m5 macbook is

The macbook m5 base itself is 150$ more 

PRICES ARE THE SAME 🤡🤡

You could have done a single google search and could have found your idiotic statement to be completely false but I guess that's too much for you to do😂😂

    ↳ @Soon_hin3  👍1  2026-02-17
    And the price difference increased the more upgrades you do

    @Imorge The legendary Thinkpad of legends. It's less likely to die from a drop or spill, true enough. But assuming a normal responsible owner, it will actually en-dure less in longevity than a MacBook Pro, and thus be less dur-able. Simply from performance, thermal, wattage, and longevity stats. Before we even talk about the software it might run.

    ↳ @WutsInYourMind  👍0  2026-02-17
    ​@CorneliusTaylor-s1u I went from windows to mac on my personal machine a few years ago and I still think MacOS has been designed by psychopaths. You are correct that there is always a learning curve to anything new and one can't just use mac like they've used windows for their whole lives, like many of us have, but I'll argue that MacOS is just objectively a poor user experience design wise. It takes a while to scour through the settings and install some 3rd party (probably paid) apps to make it usable.

Windows' utilitarian approach used to be a strong point but 11 is just a mess and microsoft is having a mental breakdown so for those reasons I'd still rather use a mac, not because I actually like it.

That said, KDE Plasma is a better designed desktop environment than either of the above, but any of the Linux desktop distros of course won't be a drop-in replacement for the masses any time soon. I have CachyOS on my home theater machine and I do prefer it to MacOS for daily use, until something spontaneously breaks and I have to whip out the "real" computer.

What baffles me is how Windows laptops have basically brought this upon themselves. They had 5 years to catch up with Apple Silicon Macs, yet instead Dell killed the XPS line, Asus kept struggling with Quality Control, and Microsoft... well, released Windows 11. By this point it almost feels irrational to NOT buy a MacBook instead

    ↳ @TalesOfWar  👍0  2026-02-15
    Windows isn't important for Microsoft any more. Not directly anyway, it makes very little of their actual revenue so they're just using it as a way to feed their other investments like slurping up everyone's data for training their crappy LLM's. It truly baffles me how CRAP Copilot actually is despite the amount and kind of data Microsoft have to train it on.

[163] @garminizator  👍6  2026-02-15
Interesting to hear macOS Tahoe being... quite bad, no way around it. I installed macOS Sequoia on my PC just for some Hackintosh fun and it's just such a beautiful operating system. Apple moving it all to Liquid Glass looks like throwing something out the door long before it's ready just because they needed something new to release urgently as they didn't have anything special to release otherwise. I guess they'll fix it, of course, but right now, Liquid Glass everywhere feels more like a beta release rather than a finished product ready for mass use. As for the MacBook and Mac in general, there's no comparison for tasks in which it excels, the hardware quality, power and efficiency is on a different level altogether. Far too expensive for any RAM and storage upgrades, though, Apple is raking in some seriously massive amounts of cold cash in profits there.

    They are not premium, though, so it's a poor comparison. Compare with the Dell XPS and Surface Laptop, both of which are premium. Of course, there will be mid-range laptops that are cheaper, but that is not a like-for-like comparison. Apple has the MB Air at $800, which competes with cheaper Windows machines. It appears you do not understand basic retail business.
