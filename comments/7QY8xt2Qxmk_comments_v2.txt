Original: The MacBook Pro M4 is 1349 on Amazon so the only MacBook Air variant that makes sense to get is the 16/256 base variant.
Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.73)

    ↳ ➖ @flxing42  👍13  2025-10-18
    Original: Unless you really like the lighter weight of the M4 Air
    Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.75)

Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.90)

[3] ✅ @seacow1970  👍0  2026-01-14
Original: I think M4 Air is best for me. I just entered the details of  my 2019 MBP and apple said they will give me upto 170 quid. I might as well keep it then! I won't get a better (spare) laptop for that. I moved to m4 mini recently, but really covet the M4 Air in black. However, I think I will wai for a bit and see what the new Air is like later on.
Sentiment: positive (confidence 0.69)

Original: 1000 nits is not twice as bright as 500 nits.

You don’t need a 70W charger to use the M4 chip at maximum capacity. The maximum power draw of the M4 chip is way less than 70W and Apple Silicon laptops run at full power even on battery. Not only that, but the M4 in the Air will thermal throttle after a few minutes of sustained load and will draw even less power.
Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.60)

    ↳ ➖ @cppai  👍5  2025-10-18
    Original: From a physics perspective, the author is still right: twice as much. But from a human perspective, it's an logarithmic increase, only about 1.3 times as much 😊

Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.61)

------------------------------------------------------------

[12] ➖ @kaischmidt730  👍2  2025-10-21
Original: Windows Hello (Face ID) already worked on my Surface Pro 4 from 2015, can't understand that Apple still hasn't brought that to the Macbook. The touch ID is fine, but Face ID is a lot more convenient.

Original: I was considering buying an 13 inch 24 GB 1000GB storage Macbook Air, but...I already own a quite good enough Lenovo Legion laptop, so at least for the moment I will not consider Apple laptop. Though I am considering and struggling to decide for a tablet (base iPad, Air or 11 inch Pro or 13 Inch Pro). For the moment I am still thinking and checking reviews.
Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.70)

[14] ➖ @Sayitlikeitis1234  👍0  2025-11-25
Original: Stop posting bullshit. The 15 inch is $949 currently at best buy. The 13 inch is the cheaper one. Plus if you have a Best Buy visa you can get this for 24 months interest free. Puts it exactly at $43.90 a month with the tax

Sentiment: positive (confidence 0.97)

------------------------------------------------------------

[16] ❌ @richardnegyesi  👍2  2025-10-21
Original: I love every aspect of this MacBook Air except the keyboard. The keys feel cheap compared to the rest of the machine, and some of them are wobbly out of the box for me. This is driving me nuts, as I expect the keyboard quality to match the premium feel of the device.
Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.42)

    ↳ ✅ @brinraja  👍1  2025-11-29
    Original: Totally agree. Switched from an 8 yo Lenovo Yoga and the keyboard feels so cheap and trash on my Macbook Air. However, the trackpad is phenomenal.

    Original: @lildvl10 Im curious about this too. I mainly used my m2 air for watching content, so I'm not sure if it is worth to upgrade to a pro only for it's display and 120 hz.

    Original: ​@polum it ISN'T slightly better but for average person just don't get a pro. You'd think you'd actually use it for extremely power hungry stuff but in reality you really wont use it for stuff like that.
    Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.82)

    ↳ ➖ @RainGreenPortable  👍1  2025-10-31
    Original: ​@lildvl10 You're gonna use it just to watch streams and basic stuff? Better get an iPad at that point lol. Get an M1/M2 Macbook Air since they're really cheap now if you're using it for watching streams and stuff.

    Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.88)

    ↳ ❌ @Combat-Janitor  👍1  2026-01-04
    Original: ​@Mike-Oxlong-XXLLiterally the first thing I said out loud when watching that. I have little concerns about ai tooling itself, but rather how much confidence non-technical people have in them.

Either through a failed audit, or worse, a lawsuit from a data breach, these people are gon' learn.
    Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.51)

    ↳ ❌ @Mike-Oxlong-XXL  👍0  2026-01-04
    Original: @C@Combat-Janitorhe issue is that what you described already happened many times now.

Non technical people won’t learn. They’re like a donkey with low IQ  busting their foot on the same stone 100 times, never learning.

Part of the responsibility is also with channels like these that pretend there are no security implications and that everything is fine.

I work for an AI company during my dau job, but when I mention security to non technical people I am considering to be a narcissistic, know it all with a negative view on the world 🙄

Original: guys those of you looking at these reviewers the idea that the mb air is simply good enough for a basic user is simply an ignorant incomplete thought (no offense) but the mack book air can do so many kind of developing editing and desktop tasks that its more than enough for 99 percent of people due to the fact that even lowered versions are punching way up their respective levels

Original: theres really no reason to overspend on storage on Macbooks when you can get a Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSD at 1 TB of storage and an M.2 Enclosure to Thunderbolt for less than 100 dollars, which is better than spending the high price of only getting an extra 256 gigabytes of internal storage at 200 dollars extra.

[37] ❌ @talashk615  👍0  2026-01-11
Original: dont macOS is smooth, stable, and well‑integrated with Apple devices, but it comes with clear weaknesses: it’s expensive, limited to Apple hardware, offers far less customisation than Windows, and has weaker gaming support with many titles unavailable. It also struggles with certain specialist or Windows‑only software, lacks touchscreen options, and gives power users less freedom to modify or upgrade their system. On top of that, the trackpad while responsive for gestures—can feel overly sensitive, inconsistent, or awkward for precise tasks, which some users find frustrating compared to traditional mouse control.

Original: I just can't believe people still downplay the performance on these Airs. I've got an M2 (waiting on M4 15 to be delivered next week) and it has  handled anything I have thrown at it in terms of Blender, Final Cut, Ableton, Premier Pro...etc. To say these laptops are good for "general computing purposes" is crazy work. There truly is almost no reason to get the Pro. 

Can you game? Not likely unless you are talking very small ones. Anything else? These melt faces. Whoever says they are for "general purpose computing" has lost the plot.

    ↳  @CryoXerxes  👍3  2026-01-17
    Original: For those asking about the differences of a Flash Drive and Hard Drive, while both are a protable storage system, HOW each tech stores its files is the main difference.

Flash Drives are named so for the fact they are usually small, with a connection hardbuilt into its casing so you can just bring it out, plug it in to a proper port and it IMMEDIATLY  starts working. This makes it great for secure small scale transfers like photos, small videos, or documents too big for email.  Downside is due to the main focus being Plug n' Play, it is SIGNIFICANTLY harder to customize HOW your files are stored an who would have access on it. This combined with the fact they come with combatibility software for most operating systems means its essentially a digital basket that is hard to organize. But in almost all caaes the internal componetnts of a flash drive tend to be smaller than an egg yolk, so companies can make a ton of custom shells for fairly cheap and thats a big selling point. 

External Hardrives on the otherhand are as the name implys, similar to your own Computer's hardrive but on the outside. This means you get all the same functionality of say your C:: drive limited only by the quality of your computer's connection ports and cabeling. They tend to be on the larger size usually about the same to up to twice the size of a standard gaming mouse, which makes portablility and cable management challenge at times. But with EHDs and a bit of know-how  you can store your entire gaming system on it without bloating your main computer systems and allows you to better streamline how your computer's resources get allocated.

Both have their own pros and cons but are not easily interchangable.

Original: regarding the transfer process around 6:30, you guys always choose to overcomplicate this.  I've owned 4 MacBooks over the last 5 years and never once have I had to use the transfer/migrate process.  All of your files, your desktop and everything is stored via the cloud.  When you sign into a new Mac with your Apple ID all of that stuff just magically appears over the course of a day and stays there.  This is what I've done every single time I got a new MacBook.  Basically just signed in and it took care of mirroring the new MacBook to my old MacBooks.  Not sure why you people complicate the process.  And no, I don't pay for some expensive cloud plan either, I'm pretty sure I have the. most basic/cheapest cloud storage plan (idk, it's like 2.99 a month).

The need for app and video file storage space was why I chose the 512GB upgrade, but the included GPU upgrade helps with the 8K video editing I deal with for 360 videos.

    Original: I cleaned it for all the shots! Haha. It will smudge, especially if you use hand moisturizer or anything like that on your hands. That being said, I really liked that color better than the silver, which I originally got but returned and exchanged for midnight. I keep mine in a case and don’t end up cleaning it that often, it seems to look pretty good most of the time. - Josh

I've worked at home online for the past six years using an old 21" iMac from 2010, and a 13" M1 MacAirand am just now to the point of looking at an "upgrade" and 24" will be more than enough for me.

Then I report this issue to apple halifax and they said the repair cost is $ 975.00 because I was not taken apple Care too . Then I spoke with senior advisor and decided to repair under consumer law and once I provide them for repair after one week they called me again and said "Liquid damage found" and does not cover under consumer law and repair cost is $2418.00 and "God promise this was not my fault because i kept it through out its life in bag only I barely used with top care ( < 50 hours ) and there is no chances of external liquid from my side.

Original: I absolutely love the 15" MacBook Air - It's my daily driver for everything work and personal.  I also have a 16" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and it's fantastic as well ... but I hate traveling with it.  It's a bit chunky and the extra weight is tiresome when it's in your backpack all day long.  Performance wise, the M4 can outpace the M1 Pro in all of my workloads, even web development using C++ and Web Assembly.  If you set your projects up right - incremental builds are fast and painless.  It's a developer thing - mostly working single files at a time, needing quick bursts of performance to compile them in the scope of a larger project.  And for those larger projects my MacBook Air is MAXED OUT with 32 GB of Unified Memory and 2TB of storage.  Most people will opt for the faster processors and better graphics of the MacBook Pro, but I would much rather get more Storage.  That second TB is costly at $400, but it's so nice not packing an external drive - just grab it and go.
