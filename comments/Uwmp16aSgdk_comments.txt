    yeah, m1 macbooks are still pretty good

    ↳ @Yimello  👍12  2025-03-11
    Same, it's amazing how they've held up in terms of performance. Was thinking about getting the M4 but I think I could hold out for another generation or two.

    I just bought one last month, made sure to find a 16gb/512gb model. It's still a great little machine.

    still sucks that apple charges 200+ dollars for more ram or storage

    So what… My 2014 mba with 4gb ram is running 24/7 as a security cam. Best thing about it is the logo lights up 😎

I have a mid 2021 Macbook Pro. My next Macbook will probably be the Air. I don't need a pro. I only got the one I have now, because of the 4 USB-C charging ports (2 on each side). It's real convenient when it comes to charging. Other than that, I would be fine with the Macbook Air.

------------------------------------------------------------

[11] @Lucamitm  👍0  2025-08-15
Is m4 any good for photography? Thanks

------------------------------------------------------------

[12] @thomasnewsom6084  👍4  2025-03-13
Bravo! Finally someone said what I have been saying for a long time. For me at a certain level it's not about the processors as the M3 and M4 can handle most anything.But why oh why can't I have a better screen on the Air even if I have to pay extra as an option??? Also my pet peeve as a storage developer for a lot of years is why can't they just leave the 3rd Thunderbolt port in the Air. Sometimes it's just about connectivity and not just ripping performance. I'm also not wanting the extra port to connect yet more displays for crying out loud. 
I appreciate the great videos you have done over the years and hope you continue providing a calm voice in an environment that can become a bit screechy at times.

    It already got it some time ago!

    ↳ @benlau2045  👍10  2025-03-11
    But then the 24gb ram will be the next 16gb ram in a few years.........and then many ppl will recommend the 24gb ram over the 16gb.......the cycle continues.....if u know what i mean......
The 8gb ram last time in 2012 was king ........

    16 GIGS OF NO GAMING NO THANKS

    ↳ @dededed1  👍1  2025-03-11
    16 is twice as good as 8gb i have on my mac last 5 years, so its great anyway.

    ↳ @zachcarmichael699  👍0  2025-03-11
    It's so they can inevitably force Apple Intelligence to always be on, so then you're screwed out of that RAM

    ↳ @jihnsi  👍10  2025-03-11
    @silhe6904 You wouldn’t even buy a MacBook Air for gaming, set some realistic standards.

    ↳ @MultiNakir  👍0  2025-03-11

    ↳ @SyedFaiz3347  👍6  2025-03-11
    ⁠@manuscript-05stop with the “NO GAMING” macs aren’t really meant for games and also now Apple works with game developers and games like resident evil, and civilisation 7 are on Mac. But if your just some random Fortnite kid. Just go back to using your ps5 then?

    ↳ @TamasKiss-yk4st  👍3  2025-03-11
    @benlau2045 that is only true for Windows machines.. the 8GB memory Macbook still completed the most demanding benchmarks without any Windows weakness: "sorry you need more RAM to use this application".. so when the 8GB Laptop still outperform the 16GB Windows Laptops, than you should separate the two things.. yes it's help a lot if you have more RAM, but it still continue to run the program without error messages, and at the end of the day only that is count, would it able to do what you wanted or not, because of not enough memory errors or blue deaths... (sure the benchmarks are important, but how often you will use your car at maximum performance? How often bothers you if the dashboard is only counted to 240km/h and not to 360km/h..? If the "smaller" max capacity is still able to do the work properly, who cares, the other car have a different dashboard with different max speed limit..?)

    ↳ @heroninja1125  👍5  2025-03-11
    @TamasKiss-yk4st Thats full of cope, 16 is better then 8 no matter how much you try to twist it. MacOS will just eat up memory swap which lowers the performance and lifespan of the device, but judging on how you have written this comment, you probably replace your macbook every 3 years like a good little consumer. 

Theres nothing wrong about enjoying a cute little two cylinder prius that carries your groceries, but some of us want minivans or trucks because we have work to get done and need to get things from place to place. We don't use our devices as a dedicated netflix watching device like you do.

    ↳ @DavidCowie2022  👍0  2025-03-11
    Remember when Windows XP launched and everyone thought it was bloated because it had a minimum memory requirement of 64MB and ran a lot better with 128? Good times.

I have the new M4 air, in the new color and in the smaller size 13in' i believe. It's the best laptop I've ever purchased. The quality is incredible, it feels premium and everything about it blows a Window computer out of the water. It also keeps me more productive. The size perfectly fits for travel, and the monitor is S tier. Great laptop, I hope this lasts me a very long time

    ↳ @rexlapis07  👍2  2025-08-29

Just bought the Mac Pro M4 last week. Loved my Air 2017 all these years but for me it was about the screen size. The new Air 13" looked smaller than my old one and didnt like that very much but I also felt like the 15" was a bit too much. 14" Mac Pro was the sweet spot for me.

I'm quite late, but after 6 months my recomendation if you buy this laptop is to disable Apple AI. It's almost useless and you save a lot of ram. 16Gb with AI isn't that much, but disabling it is more than enough ;). I love this little machine

    ↳ @abdi9626  👍0  2025-03-12
    @thehardyboys4227 1. you sometimes dont realise it right away
2. if you have a 120hz monitor with windows its sometimes set to 60hz by default. just right click on your home screen, click on display settings, scroll to the bottom and click on advanced display. there you find the refresh rate.
and 3. in gaming it really does make a significant difference.

    ↳ @AmanKumar-wh8tk  👍5  2025-03-12
    Never really understood the need for a brighter screen ever. Do folks work in front of the goddamn Sun? I have a MacBook Air M1 and this baby is the best piece of tech I have ever owned, and I own quite a few of them. 60Hz is a bummer though, when all other devices you use have higher refresh rate.

    ↳ @melxvee6850  👍0  2025-03-15

It’s time to stop pushing these products as ‘Pro.’ My $5,000 MacBook Pro has a major design flaw, the keyboard scratches the screen (not enough clearance), and Apple calls it ‘normal wear and tear.’ Customer service ignores the issue.

That said, on my 2020 MBA M1 base with 256GB, I still have 90+GB free 5 years later and I use it every day. If you need extra storage, grab a small external SSD to store your actual files on.

    @ Yea I feel like the MacBook Air is good but it really has 2 issues.
1stly the Storage, it should be 512gb or 1TB, I get external ssds but then your laptop isn’t like gonna fit well ina bag or something.
2nd the refresh rate, 60HZ hurts in 2025

    Unless you need to work off a Windows share while remote over a VPN ... then macOS blocks opening EVERY SINGLE BLOODY FILE. That's why I gave up, moved the Mac to the living room, and bought a new Windows box for the home office. I just couldn't get work done efficiently on it. Plus, macOS does weird things when trying to use home/end/pg up/pg down in a document. My cursor doesn't move, but everything on the screen does ... and there is no native clipboard history. After you spend a few years using that daily for productivity it is a HUGE leap backwards. Amazing hardware. Full props to Apple for that, but their software design decisions make it frustrating AF to use for actual work. At least for me, living in a Microsoft environment. Probably the cat's meow if you ONLY use Apple software and Apple products for your entire life though.

    Imo 256gb is fine for a base MacBook air. It's the most entry level apple computer all in one, targeted towards people who only need to store documents and everything else is on the cloud or in a browser. 

For a MacBook pro, I agree the minimum should be 512 or 1tb but for a student, I rarely fill my 256 unless it's filled with a bunch of videos from a couple projects. My desktop has 12tb but for my work laptop, I don't need anything storage intensive and if you do, you'd probably need more performance like if you're editing videos you wouldn't have an air in the first place. ​@Flattithefish

    @Allys96 Really appreciate your points. Well full disclosure my first Job was with Apple and I left in 2011.. 
I have seen Apple make plastic crap; and plastic tanks; the unibody CNC Aluminium design we have today was chosen primarily due to the heat dissipation properties.
Sadly, that was never used like it was supposed to. See, around this price point, whatever PCs are available are more computers. Don’t get me wrong, but in absolute truth an ARM SOC design was never meant for a full stack computer. That’s why IO ports are an issue.. 

These are great with battery and almost anything.. but when you really throw actual software on it (not apps, Application Stacks) the ARM architecture begins to struggle..
But 95% users have nothing to gain or loose there.. just that during the Power PC days the IBM chips used to be more capable than x86.. this direction is reverse. So that’s my perspective.. buy what will be useful for you, that’s good for all.

    @suhulfx With each product generation, Apple is using more recycled materials.. but the prices keep going up. Manufacturing Costs are coming down, but the profit margins keep swelling up.
Am I dumb or are you gullable.. is not a debate.
That is the price one should get this hardware for. But you can pay more so they will sell it for more. Eventually we are promoting this hype cycle.
SOC's originally were invented and used for cheaper compute capacity.
The Apple Studio monitors or the XDR displays for what they do are actually much cheaper than other products in the professional world. A $1000 stand, is a rip off. That's what I am saying.

Lots more things are the same, lots of hype about download speeds with broadband but most equipment can't handle the speeds anyway so you never notice any difference.

    @suhulfx I've been buying Surface devices since they started and still have most of them in full working order because I never get around to selling them on when I upgrade. It's mostly just marketing nonsense to get you to believe you're paying all this extra money because you're getting a far better product and it's mostly hype. They're pitting us against each other to make us think we have a better product than the other guy. Here's the thing: Nobody actually cares which computer or phone you own or which car you drive. You do figure it out eventually and stop pissing your hard earned into the wind so much.

    ↳ @TheCoolistic  👍0  2025-03-15
    @suhulfx No, the dumb thing is you pay top dollar because you fall for the hype. That's exactly what the marketing gurus want you to believe, and you fall for it. We all do. That's why these companies are so successful. eventually, after so many years you get pissed off at forking out another $1000 or so on the next great iteration of the product and eventually you realise you just bought the exact same thing as you bought last time with about $5 worth of tweaks. 

My daughter buys Apple, I prefer Windows and the touchscreen is a big thing for me, but I've done the same with Surface devices and eventually you realise you can pull out a 5 year old one and it still works in exactly the same way, at virtually the same speed as your shiny new one. You're slightly in the crap with Apple because you can't buy a different brand if you want to stick with their OS but 99.9% of us don't need much more power or speed than you can get with a $400 computer. They're having us over and we're all falling for it, but don't worry, you do work it out eventually. Remember, nobody cares which computer you use, which phone you buy or which car you drive. The only thing that's affected is your bank balance and your ego.

    ↳ @TheCoolistic  👍0  2025-03-15
    @jeremylopez2101 Well there is, but not if you want to stick with Apple's OS, that's where they have you over a barrel. 9 times out of 10 you're not buying anything that's much better than the one you're replacing anyway and they know it. Eventually you realise that you just spent another £1000 for a computer with barely £10 worth of improvements over the last one and you stop falling for the "upgrade" con every couple of years.

    ↳ @TheCoolistic  👍0  2025-03-15
    @-psychochomp-4910 There are plenty of decent £400 laptops out there, 99% of us don't need the storage or performance we're paying for anyway. But it's OK to spend what you want or need, just don't fall for the upgrade con every couple of years. You do stop falling for the hype and figure it out at some point, when you get fed up of spending another £1000 every time the marketing guys tell you that you need an upgrade.

    ↳ @TheCoolistic  👍0  2025-03-15
    @ChrisPollard Exactly. I've been buying Surface devices for years and they're equally as good but without the limitations of Apple. I wouldn't know what to do now without a touchscreen so that's the kicker for me, it would be like going back in time and all the Surface devices I've had have been fantastic and reliable. 

The biggest problem we all have is we fall for the marketing hype which is designed to get us thinking one is better than the other, that you are buying the best ever. After a few years "upgrading" then realising your shiny new laptop isn't much faster, sharper or better constructed than the last few you bought. Is your new laptop really any better than the same model you bought 5 years ago and the other three inbetween?  The penny drops and you stop buying pointless upgrades just so you can have the latest kit, and guys, nobody else cares what phone, laptop, car, or anything else you have.

    @ what laptops would you be recommending for below 300 dollars? I’m not quite sure you’re aware of how powerful the M4 chip is, but I also don’t know much about low end laptops, to be fair! If you have anything that competes, I’d love to save those 600 bucks!!

    First, I wouldn't recommend a high-end laptop for real work to anyone.  

Next, we need to see if using a different OS is even an option for someone or this won't go anywhere. If you trapped with MacOS and MacOS programs, then it doesn't matter if the replacement is $50 or $5000, you don't really have any non-Apple choice.  When there isn't any competition for other reasons, acting like raw performance matters is a waste of time.


If you earn a living with very specific software and hardware, nothing else will work. Stick with it.

OTOH, if a laptop is for typical home uses - browsing, social networking, very light video editing and watching, then there's little need for even a $300 laptop.

For example, 
Ebay has a Dell Latitude 5420 - Laptop 14" Core i7-1185G7 3.0GHz 16GB RAM 512GB SSD that would be overkill for almost everyone's needs for $205.    Prettier versions for a little more.  Scratched versions for a bit less.  Free shipping.  Highly rated seller.  For $180, the 10th gen version is also available.  There's an ebay $10 off coupon today.
I cringe when people spend the same amount on 8th gen or older CPUs.  Friends don't let friends buy old junk.  For laptops, I'm an Intel-guy.  
My "new to me" laptop is a Core i5-11th gen that looked new. Lite, fast, great battery, beautiful screen.  
For desktops, I buy whatever is the best value for the need.  Sometimes that's a $35 Raspberry Pi and sometimes that's CPU/MB/RAM components for $350 to triple the performance/capability  compared to what I have.  I re-use old cases, old PSUs, old speakers, provided each works like new still.  My 5.1 speakers are over 20 yrs old now. Cases are 25 yrs old.  Think the last PSU I bought was in 2008.  My desktop is rated just under 20,000 passmarks. It replaced a powerful MB/CPU rated around 6000 passmarks that used 2x the power.  The cost of the new system was paid for by lower electric bills in less than 3 yrs of running. Add in my "increased happiness" and it was a huge win.


Many home users would be very happy with a Chromebook if their entire computing use revolves around websites and google junk.  A supported ChromeOS device is probably the single, most secure, computing device available today. I'm serious.  Of course, security and privacy are very different. Don't use Google stuff if you care at all about privacy. Same for all social networks that aren't federated and use strong encryption - cough Matrix.

    @WhiteG60 are you 100% sure it is set to 240hz?? you can check by rightclicking the desktop -> nvidia control panel -> change resolution and looking under refresh rate (if you have an nvidia card). even if you think it is, i would check lol, tons of people dont realize they never set it properly

    ↳ @WhiteG60  👍0  2025-03-23
    @ridge4649 Yeah I'm sure. I've adjusted it up and down, used FreeSync, etc. I just honestly don't notice a difference. I also don't play fast twitchy multiplayer games (or multiplayer at all really!) so maybe that's why? If I'm getting 60+fps in my single player games, I'm good.

    ↳ @Mikri90  👍0  2025-03-25
    @big-anvil I used to think that but now that I barely game I appreciate my high refresh rate monitor so much for anything else. Everyday usage absolutely does benefit from higher refresh rate, no doubt. 

That said, I do also have an M1 Macbook Air and I am not bothered by it, it's okay for that type of device. I notice it immediately when switching from my PC but I also adjust to it very quickly. It doesn't hurt it, but it would still be better if it had 120Hz. 

We have that on $200 phones now so I guess it wouldn't be that wild to put it into an Air.

    @xix.x0r0can’t run most programs such as Logic Pro with AU support, having a keyboard helps with shortcuts as well, you’re limited to only the app store on ipad, mac can have multiple monitors, it’s more of a work horse having the M pro chips. Really the biggest difference that i stated already is ipad OS is basically glorified IOS that can’t run 3rd party programs. I rarely use my ipad outside of drawing, everything else just feels more convenient and better to use on my macbook

    Upgrade every couple years if you’re in a position to do so. It’s hard to miss what you don’t have, but not only should you consider what’s your time worth to you, but your enjoyment, satisfaction, and excitement of using the product has a weight as well. You could go from being frustrated af your job if you do most of your work on a laptop to oh that’s cool, why doesn’t everyone have one of these real quick if you start upgrading more frequently

    ↳ @RusticRonnie  👍0  2025-03-12
    If you have 16GB of ram there is no reason to upgrade.

If you had an M1 air 8gb, and you find yourself running into issues then upgrade, I bought that in uni and have some issues in blender on larger scenes, and they issue really seems to just be ram related

    in my experience, the problem with waiting to upgrade is it the rebate that you get from Apple goes down considerably overtime… For example, I can currently get $550 for my M2 MacBook Air… Which means buying a new MacBook Air only cost me $450!But if I wait a year I may only get $250… So it's a math problem!

The problem for me with this computer is the display, once u get used to MacBook Pro 14 display, it’s hard to go back, the 120hz, mini led, high brightness, thinner bezels, I also don’t like not having a fan because if u do anything intensive on this MacBook Air, it will throttle much more because the M4 chip uses way more power than previous versions, also the 120hz on the MacBook Pro drops to 24hz when not in use and that gives me significantly longer battery life for productivity, m4 MacBook Pro is a battery beasts, I end an average day of school with like 80% after over 2 hours of use, super impressive, apples 3nm chips are so efficient now, especially compared to other m series Mac’s I have used

    Got the MacBook Air M1 as well in 2021 for $799. Best purchase I’ve ever made upgrading from a 2010 MacBook Pro that I beat up lol. Although this new MacBook Air M4 is really attractive for the price, I’m probably still gonna stick with the m1 air for a 1-2 more years.

    I have the same machine. Totally in love with it. Considering to switch to a newer version - M4 one seems to be a great solution. What brings me back a bit is that newer Air versions are not so "air" anymore like we used to have. They became so thick...

    ↳ @phillipgcox  👍0  2025-03-12
    Yeah, as someone who is not doing any photo or video editing or anything important like that and just needed a computer I have a 2020 base level MacBook Air as well and I bought it for like $700 and it’s fantastic. I suspect in like four years I’ll buy this M4 MacBook for like $700 when the M1 finally kicks it but these M chip MacBooks are phenomenal.

[160] @DJMIXXTHAT  👍0  2025-09-16
I’m not trying to be a hater but I gotta be real. Do you want a better display right but for 999? What are you expecting? I meant honestly that’s why they have the upgrades if you want better you GoPro or you go max I meant they make this version of this device for the people like me that’ll never run it past 5050% of what it can do OK and me personally totally happy with my screen more than happy. No they shouldn’t have put a better screen cause the price would be so much higher if they put nano texture, it would be it wouldn’t be a MacBook Air. It would have to be a pro because it wouldn’t have the price range to be an air. I meant OK I’m 63 years old so my first computer I’m gonna tell a story I don’t care how long it take my first computer I bought from RadioShack. It cost me $3500 and it was not upgradable. I had a 33 MHz processor. I had 520 something memory. I had a 20 gig hard drive for $3000 do y’all get it today? I’m paying I pay. I just bought an M4 MacBook Air cause I dropped my M1 and I had some plugged into the USB-C port so it broke the port inside so I couldn’t get it fixed cause it was fine. I would’ve never I would’ve been another two years. OK at least cause it was fast enough. It did well. This one’s a lot faster and I’m at zero latency now where I was at five latency on the M1 so the upgrade was worth it but you guys and I listened to a lot of you guys talk. You act like you’re not getting enough for your money go back to when I bought mine first computer or my first MacBook OK it was almost 5G back then bro and we complaining about what we got my first computer it was. Bruh was nothing portable about it. It was a big back. I mean it was old. it was it was just VGA. It wasn’t even a great screen, but it was a screen. I could see I could watch videos only but it wasn’t great but now with the technology that there is today and the value you guys are getting for what you’re getting Man I remember building my first city. My first computer could write CDs then I built my first computer. I can write DVDs I remember I’m doing it yesterday. I’ve had to buy a scuzzy card that cost $200 just to be able to record a CD. I was wanting scuzzy. You understand we’re talking way back in the day bro that computer cost me every bit of $2000 and I built it myself that was after having my Aptiva by IBM for 3500 so let’s appreciate what we’re getting for the value we’re getting it for. I only paid 799 for mine and four 799 with tax came out and I didn’t get the AppleCare. I spent about 1000 bucks OK but that’s not 3500 and this is portable and this is 1 billion times faster than that 33 Magir entail I’m gay running on 386 was it 26 might’ve been 286 I don’t remember it was so long ago but I’m trying to make it. Let’s be grateful that I meant. I would’ve never imagined that I could record myself DJing video when I didn’t even never thought of recording DJ video. I’m in A DJ so I was 12 years old and on vinyl I would’ve never guessed we’re at the level of I can record my whole video session which is normally two hours long and this computer don’t even get it might get Luker. It increases 5° from idol to me recording and DJing video. Could I even think of DJing video back then with that Aptiva no I was grateful to be able to play a video OK but you guys about I wish it needs a better screen this computer. Don’t need shit. Leave it the way it is for 799. This was a steel steel cause the previous computer I bought a refurbished for 849. I didn’t even get an extended Care on that one. This one I did just because I dropped the last one I’m older I don’t wanna drop it and I lose it this way I can replace it for less money than me repaying the whole amount. It might cost me 120 130 bucks to replace the computer if I drop it and they have to replace it when I’m trying to make it stop doing that please let’s be grateful for what technology is available today I even saw flying cars in Africa. China brought a bunch of flying cars to Africa. I would’ve never thought I’d be live long enough to see a flying car that someone can buy for $400,000 out of reach but the point is it’s available to someone if they wanted it bad enough wow let’s enjoy what we have and be grateful that God provide us with all this great technology cause Boy knows this computer is 70% faster than my old computer. You know that going from the M1 just to forward it’s 70% faster just to know that and I pay less for it and it’s a better computer cause you got center stage 10 P camera speaker sound really good on this one too I mean, I love my old speaker, but this one has a little bit more low in on it. They gave me MagSafe, which freed up my USB ports. I only had one back in the day because basically once to stay for power and you use one in the hub now I got both my ports, I can go to external screens plus my screen if I ever needed to couldn’t do that in one, so I’m grateful y’all need to be grateful for the technology that we did didn’t have that I didn’t have to come up with or you that someone else built for us to be able to have and use so let’s be grateful thank God

I'm a software engineer with a MacBook Pro for work. I grew up as an Apple hater. I'm going back to school this year for my masters degree and decided I needed a laptop that isn't owned by my company and decided to get this macbook air. Usually I go for a higher skew item because I like powerful computers.

However the value and portability of the air from this generation just seems too good to pass up. Although I like the mbp I don't really want to carry around two of them in my backpack all day.

    ​@Renovatio2142 Not everyone can cough up thousands if not hundreds of dollars to daddy Apple each year, just to have the latest stuff. Apple builds their tech to last, and I'd say the M1 MBA has half it's life still left ahead. 
If anything, it's you who are irresponsible, buying tech every year causes environmental degradation, and you're contributing to it that by not using tech for it's intended lifespan, and are just adding to the already difficult to dispose e-waste, let alone the pollution involved in manufacturing and shipping. 
You're no one to call someone poor, especially when you're the one in the wrong. Besides that, the M1 MBA is still a very capable computer and still overkill for casual day to day usage, for most of the use cases out there. 
You should buy something, only if you actually need it, especially tech. Tech is a commodity, just like food is, you should buy as and when you need it. Buy new stuff only when the old stuff doesn't serve your purpose anymore. You don't buy tech to show it off to others.

    @vvdbnhhhdd2671 Just shy of 5 years. To be extremely fair, it still gets 8+ hours on the battery but it used to get 15 or so. 8 hours on a laptop is better than most Windows laptops manage new, so it just is what it is. I just wish it wasn't $200+ for a new battery for it or I'd just replace the battery.

What are you guys doing with your macbooks in that the base model isn't fast enough for you? I have the base model air from 2020 and daily use since then, and this thing is still super fast.

    You don’t need to be a video editor to use more than 256gb especially in 2025. Years of photos and videos can take half of that easily, then a few apps or games and it’s full. I would not mind the 256gb if the option to go to 512gb was not at 200 dollars…

Just got this computer. Currently typing this comment on it as we speak and I love it so much. It's only been a few hours but compared to my 2020 Macbook Air with the intel chip this feels like i'm 1000 years into the future. I didn't get sky blue color though. I didn't like the idea of not getting a neutral color for a laptop (i wouldn't mind if it was purple tho) plus I wanted it to match my phone which is black, so I got the midnight color. So happy, bro, thanks to education savings I got free Airpods with it too!

The M4 Air is basically a “Pro” laptop already. The truth reviewers rarely say out loud: this machine is powerful enough for ~96–97% of people who think they need the M4 Pro. The Pro is only meaningfully better for a tiny niche of users doing multi-hour 4K/8K exports, heavy 3D/VFX, or ML training. For everyone else, real-world performance is identical. Apple’s product ladder only survives because reviewers keep repeating the “Air = casual, Pro = serious” story. In reality, the Air is the best MacBook for almost everyone.

Apple’s laptop segmentation strategy is to artificially differentiate insanely similar machines so customers voluntarily climb the price ladder; not because they need to, but because the tiers are engineered to feel meaningful.

------------------------------------------------------------

[233] @buttermilkoreo  👍48  2025-03-11
5:54 Exactly! Give the Pros the Tandem OLED from the iPads and give the Air the Mini LED so there's still a better display on the Pro (OLED is still king) and at the same time we get a better display on the Air. That's when I'll be upgrading next

    ↳ @buttermilkoreo  👍3  2025-03-11
    @brandon-22 It's not just the contrast but also brightness. Apple is able to push SDR at 1000 nits with the M4 MacBook Pros (you can find many apps that can do that with the previous Mini LED MacBook Pros as well) and trust me that makes a huge difference. And yes, the option for nano texture is absolute game changer especially for MacBook Air users who aren't in the market for a more accurate display but rather a more legible one because people use them outdoors alot

    ↳ @Elmackduf  👍1  2025-03-11
    This ….
They should also do the same for the iPad Air as well. The iPad Air now has a 13inch display. Now that the iPad Pro isn’t using mini led again, it would be great for the iPad Air to now come with the mini led display. And pls God, Apple should make it a 120hz display. It now impossible to justify 60hz in 2025. At least upgrade the iPad Pro to 160 or 200hz so that the Air can now come with 120. 
Apple basically charge you more for less.

keyword here is "cheaper" you don't often see companies making products cheaper. usually they only get more and more expensive and they will always find a way to justify doing so. The base Macbook Pro in 2020 was 1499 Euro now it is 1929. The base Macbook Air was 1199 Euro in 2020, 1299 in 2024 and now it is back to 1199.

    ↳ @ZeerakImran  👍6  2025-03-11
    true. but to be fair, the macbook pro now is very different from the previous geneation pro. The display for example is in a different league. In fact, the old macbook pro is more comparable to the macbook air now. So the pro has gotten much cheaper. On top of all of this, 1499 euros in 2020 is equal to around 1841 euros today. this is also ignoring increased energy costs in europe (heating the shop floors, powering all demo devices,  transportation and deliveries). this also ignores the decreasing disposable income of european customers, resulting in less purchases. 1199 euros today is equal to around 978 euros in 2020. So its actually gotten 221 euros cheaper (while the costs are much higher). The price has been made lower to increase profits, since the price of living in europe is higher now (less demand for premium products).

    ↳ @liamsz  👍0  2025-03-12
    To be fair, the 13 inch MacBook Pro was just a MacBook Air with a boxy shape, hence the cheaper price, people doing *actual* demanding work would NEVER buy a 13 inch pro because it simply wasn't fit for most demanding workloads, it was severely underpowered and overpriced, the proper pro computer (if you could even call it that) apple sold at the time was the 16 inch, the 13 inch shared its name and build, but they were very different machines overall, but now? both MBPs are the same, the only real difference is screen size. So it's more like they're now selling a smaller version of the 16inch pro.

    ↳ @colaxxi  👍1  2025-03-12

About laptops getting boring, and not much changing:  That's great.  I would love to see more of that.  Refresh the hardware every couple years, with a little better this and that.  It's a mature product.  It doesn't need to be reinvented.  The need to be "exciting" just means the feature you care about most is always potentially on the chopping block to make the new model "fresh."  I would much rather that this year's model is just a slightly better version of the previous one.  I don't need it to be exciting, I just need it to work.

    ↳ @Thetache  👍3  2025-03-12
    Yeah but Apple want to sell you a new one every year and buy back your old one for half what you paid for it and sell it to poor people for 90% of what you paid originally, they make even more money this way and keep things moving along, you paying once and keeping it for 10 years kills their buiness model.

    ↳ @poundlandspeedwagonrequiem  👍8  2025-03-12
    ​@Thetache what are you talking about, the entry price is comically high literally for that exact reason

macbooks are built like tanks and software support longevity is what they're renowned for, chalk it up to your short-lived Windows 10 bloatware if you want to talk about sustainable business models

and before you play the repairability card, it's also gotten worse on the Windows side of the ultrabook pond

    ↳ @sirnickity  👍1  2025-03-12
    @  I still find myself frustrated by software lifecycles.  Granted, I consider a 5-year-old laptop to be "gently used" and assume that it will still have some years left in it.

But I am literally running into this exact problem right now.  My general purpose computer is a 2018 Mac Mini.  Work is BYOD these days, so I keep that on my hand-me-down 2014 Mac Mini.  I have no desire to upgrade either -- they do the job just fine.  .... Except I can no longer update software on the 2014, because newer apps require a current (which these days, means "this year or last year" release) of Mac OS.  And Mac OS 13+ doesn't run on a 2014 Mac Mini.

It could.  But it doesn't.  Because .. ehh.. you've had it for 10 years.  It's time to deposit another coin if you want to keep playing.

The hardware's fine.  Apple just decided not to include drivers for it anymore, and blacklist it from the installer.  And of course they tune the dev software to require the most recent OSes and that's IT.

I know I'm in the minority here, but that should not be okay.

Some cheap and expensive suggestions. I would install 1mm thermal padding (check youtube for videos), buy a laptop cooling pad (under $20 off Amaz0n), buy an external ssd like a Samsung T7 if ~1KGB/sec is OK and if not get a Terramaster D1 for 3KGB/sec. I would also suggest getting a Rain Design stand, a NuPhy Air75 V3 keyboard and a separate Dell U2725QE monitor with 4K hub. The M4 will display two monitors but you need a Thunderbolt dock (like the one on the Dell U2725QE) to do it. M1 and M2 will only display 1 monitor.

    ​@Betelgeusewaitforit Definitely agree, I wouldn't say I directly program per say, but with economics a lot of the work is just based around running regressions and data analysis using different softwares like R or Python...I feel like most laptops would be able to handle it.

    ​@250IZ Personally, I've never used Matlab and shapefiles for my econometric research projects, but I would imagine it would be able to handle the processing just as well as Stata, Python, or R. I could be wrong though because it sounds more visual based. One thing I do know is the most important thing when it comes to data analytics is make sure you have at least 16GB of Memory. A lot of the work I do is moderately to big size data sets from IPUMS CPS, some private companies, FRED, etc. And all the data I import from there (which is a lot) has never caused my laptop to overheat or run slow. What kind of work do you with Matlab? I've always wanted work with it, but it's never been a priority to me. Do you recommend it for anything?

I'm on a beefed out M2 MacBook Pro and I'm still impressed with how amazing ARM technology is. My laptop is so good, the only way I see it ever leaving me is if I outlast the final wave of software support for it, cause it isn't even dipping in speed after a few years like Mac Laptops have been known to do. Like my 2011 MacBook Pro became extremely slow and hence getting my 2016 version. The hardware on the 2016 was fine enough (a little slow, but it could handle 20-30 audio tracks in Logic Pro X), but I had so many battery cycles with this thing, that it only works plugged into the wall. The only hardware from Apple I am interested in is a Mac Studio, because it feels like Apple has FINALLY released a good desktop experience that gets rid of my need for an upgraded laptop. 

Apple hardware has gotten so good, that now people are upgrading not because they need to, but because they want to. That just wasn't the case years back when 2-4 cores was the standard, where there was a good reason to need a better processor and more RAM. Like I love Windows and Linux and x86 hardware, but sheesh, Apple continues to impress me with every year.

Not a heavy user, mild editing and lots of office work. The reason why I upgraded was few softwares I need Aren’t compatible with my 2012 machine honestly it’s a bummer otherwise it’s a good machine despite being 10+ years old. 
I’m absolutely loving the M4 MBA. 
Best thing about Apple machines is if you are just an average user even with a bit of everything (editing, office work, school) don’t even look at the specs just get the one you can afford and you will love it.

As a full stack + robotics developer I still use my M1 MacBook Air, and I run containers and compile native apps on it and it handles it very well. Before the M1, sure, nothing less than a MacBook Pro for me, but since that, these laptops are more than capable of professional tasks, and I’m actually considering upgrading to the M4.

Non of the youtube video I saw, clarified about usefulness in coding. As a software developer our day to day job not only including surfing on net or emailing but also running codes or simulations of ML RL models. I would really appreciate if you can tell us about that part as well. As I can see Macbook Air M2 is having hard time simulating models with 8 gigs of ram and 8 Core CPU. What better does Macbook Air M4 bring us above all, with reference to the coders out there. I also request you to include your understanding of the laptop in coding. I am not much of a video editor, so I don’t know how can I compare it with coding and what resources video editing uses that might be used in coding.

5:05 I've owned the M2 air (16GB of ram) for the last couple of years and I do use Logic Pro and Ableton Suite quite a lot. It handles it perfectly, even with both programs opened at the same time. When I bought it it exceeded my expectations by far. I hope my current one still lasts a few more years, but If Apple maintains this great-deal mentality I'll definitely buy the same laptop. Plus, I must say this new color looks gorgeous.

    I’ve felt the same way with my M3. Air. It’s my first MacBook ever and despite using it every single day, I still get an immediate happy/giddy feeling when I start. Everything about it just feels perfect for coding / sys admin / etc. the keyboard, the weight, the battery life, the screen quality. And as a long time Linux/GNOME user, I really enjoy MacOS a lot and felt right at home.

    My 2012 MacBook Pro with intel and 2014 iMac (both had SSD and max ram injection) handle those surprisingly well. The only reason I’m uprgrading is absolutely mediocre gpu that can’t handle anything over 1080p, and ability to install mobile apps ( mainly for lumafusion ). I mean both these computers are ancient technology now, but both are still fine for let’s say 20 tabs in safari. Anything with M chip will be fine for 99% of people….

I'm not trying to be a hater, but I hate it when people in the first world say, "This is a super affordable Mac, designed for basic tasks." Funny thing is, I have a MacBook Air M1, and I do renders, edit videos, and work with the highest quality photos—6GB files—and it still runs without any issues. Not much to envy from the MacBook Pro M4 I got at the agency I work at, but upgrading from the MacBook Air M1 to the M4 for personal work would definitely be a great upgrade... no so cheap

Why isn't there an upgrade to air version with 120hz for like even 500$ more? It would be no brainer for many people like me. And yeah, there are really many such people who only bought excessive pro because of 120hz.

    ↳ @arnavbhargava1348  👍0  2026-02-04
    A $500 increase for the 120hz display brings the Air to $1499 and for an extra $100 you are getting more ports, a better display, and better sustained performance so there isn't really a reason to get the Air at that point.

Just to add my 2 cents.
I bought one. The base model. It is the best you can buy.
After 14 years of using MacBook Pro, my employer forced me to detour to a Windows Laptop. My goodness, what an insult. There is still basics not working. With the most insulting part being the touchpad. No, I am not the physically disabled, I am a pianist. Windows touchpad is an insult. As is the cursor. With an active cursor tip being somewhere but on the tip of the cursor graphic. Back to Apple, to the new MacBook Air, I feel caressed. Positioning a cursor is how one expects it to do. A keyboard, obviously "understanding" what key was supposed to hit. A command button on the only possible place to be anatomically best etc. etc. So, what makes the new Air even better than any Pro? Ample power without fan. Need a better display? No. The display is brilliant. Though OLED is better, and the Pro's display as well. The MacBook Air has a near very good display. Last, the on board audio is a best of its class. Such dynamic sound out of a fraction of slice of a pizzza box is just... brilliant. Adding to that is the missing fan noise. And so this MacBook is the best you can buy in means of usability of a Laptop. Simply the best mobile computer you can buy.

You said that the Air is mostly bought by people just using it for basic office stuff, but could now also be used for things you needed a pro chip a few years back. But let me tell you this: I am a programmer, working with very data intensive tasks where millions of data sets need to be processed in very few time, and I was never able to push my M3 MacBook Air even close to the limit! Apple Silicon is some serious shit I can tell you (its actually so good, that I have never even used my AMD Ryzen 9 workstation PC for programming tasks, I just connect the MBA to the screen).

I have a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and I use it mainly for music production. ProTools lags sometimes but for the most part it’s been great, I’ve mixed and master quite a few albums for different artists on it. I’m seriously considering an M4 Air but after all the videos I’ve watched I’m still not sure if it’s worth it. It’s definitely a fantastic laptop but my M1 still works great. I’m stuck on what to do.

    @keshavsakthi546true. But for most people, 8GB is really enough. Most people don’t do video editing, or anything that really requires more RAM. That’s why Apple was able to get away with it for so long.

I'm using the base M1 Air and I used it for video editing, music production, gaming, and even coding and it can handle it pretty good. And with Apple finally doubling the base RAM in new MacBooks, I would love to see them double the base storage considering storage prices are not that expensive anymore. I can buy a 2 TB SSD for $100, whereas Apple charges $800. I think 512 GB won't kill them.

    ↳ @deluxgaming6742  👍64  2025-03-12
    The thing for apple is that they make a lot of money from these upgrades, and they know that few people will actually need to have more than 512gb that means if they upgrade the entry level mac they will loose the money they currently gain on the 512 model, which I believe are quite popular.

    @ in my case it handles 1 million + lines Java app in IntelliJ Idea and compiles full build in 8 mins vs 40 on windows i9. It can be worse than top Mac Pro, but it is very good. Also air is much more portable in terms of weight and thickness, has no fun that can be point of failure and costs much less than your i9 Mac ;)

    ↳ @Doctoberfest  👍5  2025-03-12
    That's their business model though. They are really good at pricing upgrades just under the next best thing. It's also better for when they want to sell off old stock. BH was selling an M3 14" MBP with 1tb and 36gb of ram for $1,799. Same price for a M4 16gb 1tb. People looking for a deal will take their older stock so they aren't eating a huge loss.

    ↳ @Superbustr  👍15  2025-03-12
    The base storage should be 512gb and the max upgradeable storage should be 4TB instead of 2TB. One of the main things swinging me away from the Macbook Air 15 inch is not having the 4TB option. 




I need the extra storage but don't need as much processing power as you get with the Macbook Pro. You could say to just store everything on external drives but honestly for video and photo work I need the working files on the computer and don't want to be offloading files constantly onto external drives.

    ↳ @neutral139  👍0  2025-03-13
    ​@oleksandrhusiev6544 agree. If you have to run a VM cluster or whatever you're better off running it on another machine most times anyways to avoid the "apple tax" (cloud or a beefy workstation).

    ↳ @BridgeTheMan  👍4  2025-03-13
    @blindfish7812 Yup, depends on plugins but I use a M1 Air for full Ableton production no problem. If I use Diva on multiple tracks the latency chugs a bit but I rarely have CPU problems.

    Work just got me the base M3 Air (16GB of memory). I can say that the laptop handles it "as expected" not "pretty good" because of 16GB of ram. Especially when you're running multiple containers and you got other tools open too, it can get pretty slow. When we're pair programming, my boss asks is this really how fast your laptop is? (when cursor shows completions in under a second much faster than lsp can serve them in 1.3s or so). That's just the nature of 16GB for development sadly. My 32GB m1 max is still doing great for development though and I don't really have a reason to upgrade :)

    ​​@JayJayNay Well, I'd look for benchmarks, but I think there's an improvement. Also, I recommend you check if 16GB is enough or you'll need more. For storage, external ssd should be a lot cheaper than upgrading it with Apple.
Btw, remember that MBP has hdmi, SD card port, and other things that you could use/need, like mini-led panel with really good HDR.
And the M4 added ray tracing cores, perhaps helping with advanced lighting simulation tasks, but I don't really know that much about editing programs hahah.
Also, remember that Mac Mini is great and cheaper, in case you already have a monitor and don't need a lot of portability.
Anyways, M1 is still being really good, so be sure that the improvement is worth it.

Ngl im really liking this apple silicon transition. I used to own a 2017 macbook air till i bought my MacBook Pro M2 in 2022. This laptop is far superior than any laptop ive used period. Its stable, snappy and the software is seamless. Even my moms 2020 MacBook Air M1 is doing superb, 5 years later, loving both laptops!

This really good video , one day I will try make also good review on my new MacBook Air just made unboxing video. But after 1day use I can tell even this MacBook Air 15 M4 are so good and speed with second monitor, so happy I buy Air then Pro.
I don't do much stuff don't need a lot power from Mac, so this Air suits my work flow so good.

And thanks for this video looks so professional:)

I have used Dell Latitude and XPS, and Lenovo Thinkpads in the past. Last year I started using a Macbook M3 at work and was shocked at how fast and efficient it was. I use it for running often 5+ instances of VSCode, docker containers, many dozens of Chrome tabs, Slack, Spotify, 1-2 2k/4k external monitors, and it never even gets warm much less turns the fans on. I bought the Macbook Air M4 with the 512GB storage upgrade last week for personal use and I think it is the best laptop I've ever owned, and is significantly cheaper than the last XPS and the last Thinkpad I got. With these Apple chipsets and unified memory and such excellent passive cooling (or chips that don't get that hot to begin with under most workloads), Apple has so massively surpassed the PC market and Intel/AMD CPUs for the majority of users.

I dont understand why people keep saying that the macbook air is only for casual users "browsing emails, opening a few chrome tabs and editing a picture once in a while". I have been using a macbook air m2 with 8g of ram for the past two years. It got me through the end of a mecanical engineering degree, ran parametric cad for fusion 360 and is now my full time machine for doing web and backend developpement. It is doing great! Right now it is almost always running 4gs of docker containers plus multiple tabs, even microsoft stuff wich is known to eat ram on macs. I will sometimes get to 6gs of swap without the computer slowing down. I feel like there is a real market for the macbook air, when you want something light, powerfull and that has no fans. Any thoughts?

    ↳ @lufygaming1316  👍39  2025-03-11
    it is for casuals, try to run blender , after effects or any alternative , its not made for those and for that price you can get windows gaming laptops that can do all those plus gaming. Thus this is a good choice for casual stuff and portability.

    Using an M2 Air with 16GB of RAM for WEB and Backend with Docker but somehow i also get to 6GB of Swap sometimes :D
I have the case of using a displayLink dock which is pretty cpu heavy workload and will sometimes result in bottlenecking. But there is no other option to run 2 external Monitors on the M2. This is the reason why i will be happy to upgrade to the M4 later this year. Luckily in Germany the company will pay for my new device.

    ↳ @purplequi9962  👍32  2025-03-11
    He said this in the video though. You CAN do all of this on an Air, but it's not made for, nor marketed for that. It's a device for students and people who just need a computer for lower level productivity tasks like eMails, browsing or things like the Office suite.

    Exactly, it's ridiculous to phrase it as a casual machine that can 'handle' the more extreme stuff, when imo, it can do a whole lot of the 'extreme' stuff quite comfortable and is a perfectly viable machine for like 95% of workflows. If I compare it to a MacBook Pro today, for me, the value in the pro comes in the form of better battery, batter speakers and better screen rather than performance - and all three of those things are also still great on the Air.  However, I would say that if you're getting an Air (or any laptop really), you should splurge a bit on the RAM, as personally for me at least, I feel like the 8/256 config on my M2 has been a bit of a handicap. Anyways, my point was that these modern machines - esp the latest M4 gen, but even M1, have way more power than most people need for most workflows - casual and pro.

    @purplequi9962 It can do a lot more than email. The m4 is one of the most powerful chips out there and while it may not have 256gb ram, the ram it has is fast and it has good architecture. I've had no problem editing 4k movies in Final Cut Pro or producing 32 track songs in Logic Pro, outputting to 2 monitors. And thats on an m1 macbook air. Its definitely not for gaming. But there are more use cases than gaming rigs and email machines.

    it's mostly because the Air really isn't built for those tasks, it can do some professional workloads, sure, but when your job is recommending that machine, you don't wanna stretch its capabilities, like yeah you could use this maybe, if you edit videos, if you're a developer it *should* be fine, but if your work depends on a powerful laptop, you're just better off getting the best tool for the job

    @GameOver-nm2us They only make 4 tiers of processor. They gave this the lowest. Yes, they know it can do bigger things. That still doesn't mean it was made for it. If it was, it'd have active cooling and eat into the MBP market. And their advertising would show professionals using the Air. But that doesn't happen, because Apple intends for pros to buy the Pro, and the average layperson to buy the Air.

Also reviewers can get be delusional I think. They can get the most spec’d out model and upgrade every year to the latest and greatest. Of course when you then compare it to the Air which is for mortals and hobbyists it is a lot better. 

Like Marques would obviously not use the Air for his video production. But someone starting out? Why not. Airs in 2020 were revolutionized and are capable of stuff now. Prior to that yeah you'd probably have a really rough time getting away with it.

    @ivanfocused for sure, 24gb is more than enough and would definitely last you a lifetime lol, as for the storage, it's personal preference and depends on how you'd use it, but personally, i'm struggling a bit with 256gb and constantly have to delete stuff. I'd go for 16/512 or 24/512 if you can afford it. but of course, if you think 256gb is enough for you then go ahead. Look at your current computer and think about what's the limiting factor here and focus on those things. You definitely dom't have to worry about processing power in my opinion, but it would help you figure out if you need more storage etc.

    the macbook is a great device. With great devices it attracts all sorts of users for different users with different usages. Having read lots of reviews from customers on many electronic store websites, many shared what they use their macs for and there are many who just browse or watch shows with it.
 I don't think it's a bad thing if a large chunk of users are getting a reliable device for whatever they use. It lasts and in the long run you don't have to upgrade which saves up money as an effect. I personally use it for davinci, autodesk, affinity, clippaint studio and c0rnhub. Pretty poggies ngl.

I bought an M3 around last month and got a really good deal because of the lower price. It just works, for Blender, DaVinci, 20+ safari tabs, for cap cut, sometimes I open all of those apps at the same time. Can't wait what see the improvement this year with M4.

    ↳ @Ottertiles  👍7  2025-03-11
    yeah m3 AIR, and the battery lasts me for a day and a half if I just worked on a small project, if it is a big project and I need to draw more power it will last me around 7-8 hours which is more than enough for a laptop. This is an honest review from a person who never tried the Apple ecosystem before and this laptop is my first Apple device, it serves me more than I expected.

    ↳ @Ottertiles  👍0  2025-03-11
    @alanbo859  Yeah, because it has ray tracing as well. Blender can run smoothly but not super smooth like my pc. It will serve you enough on the go or just on your couch.

    ↳ @alanbo859  👍0  2025-03-11
    @Ottertiles would you recommend me to buy this m4 air (new) or older m3 pro (used), or should i get a new rtx 4060 laptop?

My primary usage is vscode, python, nextjs, and some blender for fun.

    ↳ @Ottertiles  👍0  2025-03-12
    @alanbo859  It is a tough decision because our interests are different. But because I am an engineering student I can relate to you. Let's break it down:

1. Macbook M3 pro: good if you get it at 16/512. It will be heavy especially for a laptop to carry around. It has a fan that can handle a lot of phyton, js, or simulation better than a fanless laptop. It has more battery which is a big deal.

2. Macbook Air M4: my judgment is a bit biased cuz I like to move around and get my job done outside. It will serve some improvement I believe from the previous chip and give you more portability.

3. The RTX laptop has two categories now, the lightweight like Zenbook and the chunky Bigboy like ROG, Legion, and Katana. Please make sure to get the x86 manufacturer just for more compatibility for developers. Laptops with RTX Will give you more raw power in exchange for battery life. 

a. I preferably will choose the lightweight Zenbook because it can last at least close to the Macbook. It is a bit biased because I love to move around which laptop battery is a big deal for me and also its performance.

b. If you want to get raw power but it's okay with 3-4 hours of battery life and a jet engine then it's chunky. Or seriously just get a PC, I can't survive in the wild with that kinda battery and jet engine.

Conclusion: I will recommend you the MacBook Air M4. Apple silicon will eat your everyday project like a piece of cake while giving you a long battery life. It is supposed to have a ray tracing same as M3 so js or Blender will be easy. If you're into machine learning and data mining get the M3 Pro, because of the fan. Or if you live in Canada just toss your laptop outside the fan or no fan no problem 😂

I hope this will help you make the decision.

A laptop is not a phone. 512GB storage should be the bare minimum on any laptop nowadays imo and a thousand dollars is not a small amount of money. Especially considering most laptop users keep their laptops for many years, that is not enough at all. And if it is enough to some people, then the majority of those people do not need an M4 chip at all imo. I think saying 256GB of storage is enough and bragging about the M4 chip are two contradicting statements because high performance needs complementary storage. I have no doubt it’s an amazing laptop. But I still think the base model is a sneaky illusion if you think about it.

    @Psyopcyclops It’s all relative. You might not think the same way as I do, but personally, the overall package that the MacBook offers over the rest of the competition is worth the extra exorbitant charge for any upgrades that you might need, in my opinion. 

The extra hundred dollars for upgrades that will last me for half a decade at least, is nothing substantial in the grand scheme of things.

    @ I do see your point, in that it’s not a lot of money for something you’re going to have for 5+ years, but you’re attaching a value that’s separate from its actual monetary value in comparison to the rest of industry, which is what we’re talking about. For example, the Dell XPS lets you upgrade to a 1TB NVME SSD for only $125. For 16gb to 32gb RAM, it’s $130. They use the same quality and generation of soldered DDR5 and Gen 4 NVME. I do agree that it’s not a lot of money in the scheme of things, considering how long you use it for though. It’s just unfair comparatively

    ↳ @ninjadudeofficial  👍1  2025-03-11

While the Macbook Air is a highly capable machine, I think it makes sense for most serious photographers and videographers to spend a little more and go for the Macbook Pro, specifically the mid spec one with the M4 Pro chip. The extra processing power, ports, and fans make a big difference when intensively using programs like LR, PS, and Premiere.

Hope this helps!

    @ That apple silicon had zero issues with Autodesk Fusion360. Not only that, but because the MacBook Air M1 was so efficient, the laptop didn’t need/have a fan. When everyone else’s laptops sounded like an airplane about to take off, mine was dead silent, and never not once overheated.

    ↳ @jacobgalle4297  👍4  2025-04-21
    @Bz5dr I had overheating issues on a windows laptop prior to getting this MacBook. All I'm saying is that my MacBook never had any issues with Autodesk Fusion 360. I never ran AutoCad on it. Also, certain CAD operations are difficult for any computer (like trying to convert a model with *modeled* threaded holes into an STL file). However, my MacBook always fought through it and produced the file, whereas my peer's Windows devices gave them the blue screen of death.

    ↳ @jacobgalle4297  👍2  2025-04-21
    @tuningsnow Wanna see the CAD assemblies as proof? Or are you more of an impartial observer testimonial kind of person?

    ↳ @jacobgalle4297  👍1  2025-04-21
    @Bz5dr To be fair, there were a few softwares I couldn't run on the Apple silicon, but these were easy enough to run on the lab desktops, saving my laptop battery for other work throughout the day. Why use my laptop if the lab was finishable during lab hours and they had the computers with the software ready to go on them?

    ↳ @Bz5dr  👍1  2025-04-23
    @ The only thing macbook edges over windows laptop is the battery life, that's about it. Other than that at least for heavy CAD usage, windows is still the preferred choices.

Still using the original 2020 M1 Macbook air at base specs. For general computing, it really is all you need. But I also bought a couple of Windows laptops with graphics cards at the time for cheaper, including a lenovo legion with graphics, 16gb memory and 1 tb disk drive. But the slightest use in this after the first couple of months would activate the helicoptor of a fan. The Air is not for gaming but everything else, is fine and without that loud fan!

Actually, this shows how much these rich YouTubers are disconnected from the general population. There’s like so many people (like students and in entry level jobs) who can only afford an air but want to do a lot more stuff like video editing and photo editing. Specially in counties other than the US.

Plus, you buy it to use for a while. So if someone can buy this now and use it for more CPU and Graphics intensive stuff in the future too, this is a good investment than a much more expensive pro.

Got the macbook air m4 13" today. As coming from a windows user, I find it hard to learn the apple iOS system, but I'm working on it. I think it takes a bit of time to figure out some stuff but that I'm fine it. Why I went with MacBook this time is because of mainly two things. 1. Lifetime of Mac laptops are usually much longer then for windows laptops 2. In this pricerange I couldn't find any windows laptop that would have this nice sleek design, aluminium case and also being fanless. 

The only downside is the display. It's okey for doing normal tasks, but I wouldn't watch movies or play games on it. 

Maybe I could have waited for next gen MacBook air to see if it would have different display and 120hz. But why I didn't wait to see is because of price and "if". The price here in Sweden for apple products have become redicilus. The only model that have a good price today is the entry level MacBook air. If u going with the 15" instead of 13" u have to pay around 367 dollar more. And also what will next gen cost, probably around 200 dollar more then the release price before dropping. 

I think this laptop will last me a long time and all in all I'm very happy for getting it. :)

I agree with you. I absolutely don't want to use a 60Hz display in 2025. It doesn't make much sense to buy a Pro for everyday use. I'm really torn between options. I wish they'd given the user a choice with a 120Hz option, but Apple can charge a pretty high price for such improvements.

    I still use an 11" MacBook Air as my laptop! Early 2015 model. I still love the small size. I bought it second hand  off of EBay a few years ago with an i7 2.2 GHz dual core and 8 GB RAM and 512GB storage. Still runs perfectly. Battery life is less than 2 hours now though having run through over 1400 cycles. I might replace the battery to keep it as a travel laptop. Still I am now planning to upgrade to the new M4 machine with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB memory.

    @david1610 Agree 100%!  Great point!  I may be accused of rationalizing that $200.00 for the extra memory but I figure over 5 years it is $40.00/year so $3.66/month.  Am I BS-ing myself? Possibly but thise numbers don't lie...

    ↳ @ozziekhoo  👍7  2025-03-11

    ↳ @ninjadudeofficial  👍12  2025-03-11
    @david1610 And what about all the increases that don't give you more gpu cores? Or just how dumb it is that you can't just get the extra storage. It's already absurd what they charge for iPhone storage. Google are about as bad, although samsung only charge 60 quid for the extra 128, which I don't think is at all unreasonable tbh

    @qwertyuseradminnot to dunk on a dude coming into a conversation in his non-a language, but we aren’t talking about phones, my guy. We’re talking about laptops, and Android doesn’t do laptops in any meaningful way. The MacBook Air isn’t competitive with a phone. 

Also, even if we were talking about phone processors, it isn’t so clean cut. Looks to me like the two Android phone chips you listed trounce iPhones in Antutu, but the A18 Pro smokes them both in Geekbench. The different silicon each specialize in their own ways and aren’t quite as easy to compare directly to each other.

    ↳ @RaveN_EDM  👍1  2025-03-12
    That's because the base model price is artificially low for apple so they make up that profit margin in the mid tier models. The steam deck is the same way and the disc-less PS5.  

Even at $200 more, the 512 MacBook air m4 is competitive with other laptops in its price range.

    ↳ @RaoBlackWellizedArman  👍3  2025-03-12
    It's because people preferred convenience (for a lightweight device) over freedom (for a more upgradable device) and some company exploit this vulnerability pretty well.
Soon, it's gooing to be all over the place.

    ↳ @eajayy8969  👍2  2025-03-12
    Just get an external SSD. never buy apples upgrades unless its CPU/GPU/RAM related (since those you cant do much about). Storage is much cheaper with an external SSD.

    ↳ @RaoBlackWellizedArman  👍0  2025-03-12
    @eajayy8969 Sometimes you need all your files in one place and they are huge. For instance, I need 2TB of data to be able to comfortably work. Having to constantly attach an external drvie is inconvenient. I do have about 10TB of external drive for archival purposes but those aren't essential.

    ↳ @hemmatv1582  👍2  2025-03-12
    If you live in Europe it’s 300 dollar for a extra 256gb. That’s why I still did not buy a apple laptop.

    ↳ @loider3365  👍7  2025-03-12
    16GB and 512GB should be the standard for base price MBA or at least they should reduce the storage upgrade price. If Apple is targeting students with MBA, 899 for 16GB and 512Gb would've been a killer deal. Sure you can buy an SSD but it doesn't hurt Apple to put 512GB as the base storage.

    ↳ @ygwaltgmb  👍1  2025-03-12

    ↳ @jorgeandrespalma2134  👍2  2025-03-12
    @Lofi_Velvet_Whispers Get the $999 and then spend like $80 on a 1TB ext SSD or pay the cloud storage solution of your taste. I honestly think this is the best option as you can potentially have better access to storage on the go.

    ↳ @PeterWhite-q1k  👍0  2025-03-12
    @cheesmastr5303 Hi!  Thanks for the reply.  No one is to my mind as it would cost triple with interest.  I was remarking about the typical length of ownership, not financing.  It was my tongue and cheek way to rationalize the cost of upgrades. Best wishes!

    @jorgeandrespalma2134 why spend money on an ultra portable machine and then have to carry external ssds...

    @tminus1041 Case aside, the Liquid Retina hasn't changed much and now lags most OLEDS, everyone else's base-spec 16GB has only recently become their standard (no - Apple silicone does not magically compensate), 256GB is similarly paltry, and their much vaunted user experience now trails the competition, especially in AI. With no disrespect intended, I'm not sure which internals you refer to. Most of the market is circa $1k, and most similarly priced PCs outstrip Apple by a considerable margin. It does pain me to say that as a former Microsoft hater and Apple user, but I see equal utility in a high spec Chromebook for most users. We Americans are suckers for Apple.

    ↳ @jpflu3754  👍0  2025-03-27
    @chargersfan1111 Definitely an impressive CPU.  Apple knew that changing from Intel compatibility to a proprietary chip would have pros and cons.  Running a different CPU means having a different instruction set and that emulating other platforms would be a little harder.  Having much of the system in a single chip, also called an SBC - Single Board Computer - reduces manufacturing costs and locks people into their products more than using generally available CPUs does.  

A bunch of people would buy the Apple hardware, but wipe MacOS from it and run other OSes when it was Intel-based.  Apple usually makes good, long-lasting, hardware.

My wife was nagging me about this Macbook Air for some time, she was annoyed by her Ipad M1 Pro, because of that stupid non centered camera when using the Ipad with a keyboard. She was using the Ipad 95% for her homeoffice work and online meetings, no 3D modelling or whatsoever that requires a high end mashine. Long story short, I've watched this video, got me convinced, we traded the old Ipad in and ordered a Macbook Air M4 last week. Done.

    @Yorker1998that’s how they get you! An Apple Store employee once told me that they aim to get people to think more about their second Apple device than their first one, because then they’re locked in, with how easily everything synchronizes. 

Currently rocking an M2 Air connected to an Apple Studio Display (the monitor being my favorite Apple product I’ve purchased, unexpectedly!) & Magic Keyboard / Trackpad, along with a current gen M4 iPad Pro, as well as the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Everything works together flawlessly, and little niceties like seamlessly copying and pasting between devices (even images and files) really seals the deal for me. 

Not to mention they make trading up when new phones release incredibly easy - the Apple Store offered me 2.5X what anyone else did for my iPhone 15 Pro Max when I purchased the 16, and as upfront credit vs a carrier bill credit or similar. 

Too easy, as the title says :)

I’ve gone full circle—Windows to Mac, Mac back to Windows. I had an amazing experience with an Asus N56VM that lasted 8 years. But after that, every Windows laptop I tried had issues and seemed obsolete after just 4 years. For example, my Vivobook S15 had its webcam fail after 10 months, the microphone followed two months later, and I couldn’t find any drivers anywhere—support was useless.

Now, five years later, it barely functions, and I’m planning to go back to Apple. Even when you find a Windows laptop with good specs, the battery life is almost always terrible after a couple of years—and it often costs more than a MacBook. It’s funny, because it used to be the other way around in terms of pricing, and it seems like Windows brands haven’t really improved over time.
