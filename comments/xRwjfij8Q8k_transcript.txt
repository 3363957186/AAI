How does the MacBook Air compare to the MacBook Pro? Apple's entry-level Air starts at 1,000 or 1,200 depending on size. For that, you get a good display, fast processor, up to 18 hours of battery life, the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, and all of that fits in a much smaller, lighter design. On the other hand, this is the MacBook Pro starting at 1,600 or 2500 for the larger size. Compared to the Air, it has a much better, brighter 120 Hz display, up to 24 hours of battery life, improved speakers, microphones, and a much better port selection. Plus, because there's a fan, even the base model that has the same exact chip as the Air gets better sustained performance. You can also upgrade the 14-in to the M4 Pro or Max for up to two times faster CPU and three times faster GPU performance. Or choose the 16-in model that only comes with the M4 Pro or Max, hence the higher starting price. Subscribe if that was helpful.
