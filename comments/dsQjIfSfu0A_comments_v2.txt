Original: The word BARGAIN is the crux of this argument. Bargain for who is the better question? Yes, Dell's new XPS line is way overpriced at the moment, but the vast majority of users aren't running local AI applications or editing large video projects. For most people, these laptops are far from a bargain.

    Original: Yeah, upgrading Macs, because you are forced to do so at purchase, even for the SSD, is way too expensive, and reason enough for me not to use them.

I don't want appliances, I want tools. And generally, I can work on tools.

What's cringe is your ignorance in comparing such a laptop, in fact any current Windows laptop, to a MacBook, and in what a tool is.

LOL now I have a MBP that I’m not using as much because I was using it for work. I have no issues with MacOS 26 at all. I’m sorry for the ones who have issues with it.

[8] ✅ @saturnotaku  👍0  2026-02-16
Original: I got a base M5 MBP for $1349 brand new over the holidays. At that price, I think it's worth it. That said, the outgoing entry-level M4 Pro model is regularly being discounted to $1750-1800, which makes it a stronger value than the M5 at $1599 since you're getting better GPU performance, 24 GB of unified memory, and a laptop that is quieter under load because of its dual-fan cooling solution.

[9] ❌ @AndreHansen96  👍0  2026-02-17
Original: MacOS Tahoe and iOS 26 both sucks. Lots of gimmicks like transparent glass look, unnecessary bloat, bugs, UI clutter (like adding 4 steps to something that used to take 1 step) and worst of all, it drains battery way faster than what it should. I hate the latest operating systems. Wtf are apple doing ??

    Original: Yeah but they're 27% less RAM efficient in storage and even less so in memory bandwidth, and the users are typically not using all that either, so it's much more of a mixed bag comparison of pros and cons than you make it sound.

This video shows difference sized pros (16,14), cross generation chips that are different tier (m4 pro, m5 base) and then you just set a baseline using airs? It makes no sense.

    Original: @im.Gerard And performed exactly the same as the Air. I anything M5 is the first tgeneration where you can use the baseline M-chip in a more production oriented chassis that is not a refuse on the lineup. The performance in these benchmarks won't change, the generational improvements are the same...sustained work is a different story but you can't buy a new M1 these days anyway...

Original: The MacBook Air packages get less power than the pros. Saying that the m5 is getting double the power than the m4 and that’s why it’s so much better is stupid. You should have used an m4 MacBook Pro for actual real differences where you would see that they use similar power levels, with the m5 using just a bit more not double

[26] ❌ @Marko-nx9eq  👍0  2026-02-15
Original: Close but not yet imho.  If you run macOS only after reboot, 15 GB RAM is eaten (don't forget that is ram is shared) so 32 GB is bare minimum. 512 GB for 2026 and media producers is big joke. If you want upgrade, you must buy new. OLED display, 2TB  SSD and 32GB  RAM for that price is ok.

Original: Whey did this seem like an extended commercial for the M5 MBP?  Most M2-M4 Air users will never push their laptops to those extreme multi-core CPU performance levels.  The M2 Air single core CPU performance is still excellent to this very day. 

The only rational reasons to get the M5 MBP from that audience (MacBook Air crowd) is for the extra ports, better display, better screen refresh rate, and to play the new games available for MacOS.

    Original: Yes.. While I appreciate the work involved, comparing the M5 (which has a fan) with the rest of the Airs makes little sense performance wise, and hits different audiences/buyers.

Let alone the fact that you can get an M4 Air for half the price of the M5 and use it for the next 10 years. That's the equivalent of $7 a month, less over time due to inflation, that will help you make money. Little productivity monsters.

MF comparing a pro to the base spec and saying that the fan helps the bro is dumb ass type stuff. Compare the m4 pro OF THE SAME DAMN SPEC TO THE m5 PRO OF THE SAME DAMN SPEC. JESUS YOU CANT ACOUNT THE UPLIFT TO A BETTER MODEL NUMBER THAT WAS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR M4. Im sorry im low key so mad I watched this tho. I like apple like a lot of you but this is the equivalent of when apple has a graph that just says the new product is 2x faster without providing what its faster than 😂😂😂

Apples cpus now have a hardware compressor for ram, so it will compress apps that is not needed in realtime in memory.. and decompress it in realtime when you tab to it again. This makes the M4 i have feel like it has more like 20GB of ram than 16GB.  With all apps running that i usually use, I use around 11GB ram, meanwhile my Linux computer uses slightly less with same apps.. and Windows 11 when I used to use that.. was like 9GB just booting up lol.. not to talk about VRAM..

But the M4 has a way better hardware memory compression than the M1 Pro has, since the M4 also features Dynamic Caching and ARMv9 instructions which has optimisations for this. So my 16GB feels more like 20GB. On my Linux desktop I have 64GB ram, but I never run out of it with the apps I use.

    Original: ​@AndrewTSqthis is blatantly untrue. Max Tech, the tech brother duo who started their tech career at AppleInsider, were one such channel that literally noted it was similar to Windows in that regard. Both need around 4 - 5 GB of RAM at idle from a cold boot.

Meanwhile, I can literally run a full Linux distro with less than 3 GB of RAM with something like LXQt or Xfce, and it will work fine. Obviously, more RAM helps, but swap isn't used nearly as often there.

And keep in mind that constantly using swap space will burn through read/write cycles on the SSD. Nearly every Windows device has it replaceable. Macs? Only the desktops do, and not the MacBooks. That literally means you're left with a brick once those are exhausted, as now you'll need a soldering kit.

    Original: ​@cameron_bosch "need" is where the slip happens. Apple Silicon dynamic caches loads a lot of stuff it DOES NOT NEED and is OPTIONAL in order to get massive speed efficiency. Unused RAM is wasted RAM, so by anticipating and preloading the memory you're most likely to use, performance is accelerated. If you take a 8GB Mac and a 16GB Mac and a 24GB Mac and load the same three programs, you'll notice the 16GB "uses" more than the 8GB, and the 24GB Mac "uses" more than the 16GB. Do not confuse this with "need". In general the statement that a Mac only needs half the RAM as Windows is an exaggeration in most cases. In same software testing I found it's not a scalar like 2x, but rather, a function more like 1.19x + 1.31GB. For a 16GB Mac that's roughly equivalent to (1.19)*16=19.04 + 1.31GB = 20.35GB. 20.35/16=1.272. Far from 2x, but +27% better memory efficiency is nothing to sneeze at.

    Original: @CarlSnub 1. It's not a VM. It's a hypervisor; think of it as ALMOST running bare metal Windows on ARM. 2. The answer to your question comes down to CPU performance. Top tier CPU's on Windows machines are roughly equivalent to the M3 chip or in other words two years behind Apple Silicon BASE MODEL chips. Most Windows machines are NOT running top tier CPU but something even farther behind. So yes, under a typical scenario, it scores better than Windows on bare metal. Can you get a Windows machine with Threadripper and RTX 5090 and compare it to a 6 year old M1 Mac and easily outperform the Mac running Windows? Yes. But on even terms (say cost), the Mac running Windows outperforms the PC running Windows.

    Original: @cameron_bosch Incorrect. I'm commenting to you now from Windows on Mac. With an official Microsoft License.
If running Linux as the boot OS, it's not that the support is bad, it's that your distro is limited to one that can take advantage of all the Ferrari-like hardware under the hood. But it's Arch-based, by the way, so no problems there, you can literally turn that into anything you want.
In the a world where Mac is best at everything EXCEPT (1) headless Linux server development, AND (2) Running rare niche software that's only available to Windows, the answer SHOULD be obvious except where one faces one's own ignorance.
macOS for everything except headless Linux server dev (which you run in container/VM), and Parallels outperforming Windows at Windows software, inside macOS.
There's simply nothing you can argue about it, Mac covers all three and nothing else does.
Now then, in a world where the main use case of the PC is hosting an RTX 5090 for gaming, that's the only world where you can MAYBE argue for the PC, and only then depending on what games you play and how resource intensive they are. I'd argue if you're not a 240fps pro-gamer making a living off tournament money, Mac is still the better choice even in that world.

    Original: @Doctor_Technopolis My day job is IT infrastructure and I run a huge VMware environment.  We have Hyper V and XCP-NG as well.   By the way I have a M4 Macbook Pro 16inch and a Mac Mini M2 Pro, along with various Windows machines, and a Thinkpad with Fedora on it.

The "HyperVisor" is the layer that VM's run on.  It controls access to hardware.  Parallels is a Hypervisor, type 2 that sits on top of MacOS.  VS a type one, like ESXi or Hyper V that are type 1, and the host OS is just another VM, sometimes called the control VM.  Type 1 Hypervisors are closer to the metal and faster than type 2.  They are also way more stable, since the host OS VM could crash and the other VM's keep running.  If the host OS crashed on a type 2 hypervisor, it all comes down.

Windows on ARM emulates Windows x86/64 apps when they are not ported natively to ARM for Windows.  So AutoCad 2025 is a x86/64.  If you try to run it on Windows on ARM, any call to the OS/Hardware that is made in code for a x86/64bit processor will be translated to the Windows on ARM equivalent.  The App sees an emulated version of Windows x86/64.  If that emulation is not perfect, you get issues.  Also that process slows it down and you do not get native performance.

So if you want to run AutoCad 2025 on on MacOS, you fire up MacOS, the HOST OS, then you startup Parallels, they TYPE 2 hypervisor, then you start Windows on ARM VM, then load up Autocad for x86/64 which is being emulated to run on Windows on ARM.  That is a A LOT of layers to go through and possible break points.

Exact same as the M1.  I have a Mac Mini M1 with 16gb that I use in the studio and until they increase the core count on the M5, I'll just stick with that.  It's not enough of a performance boost to justify the cost.  The only options that would give me a good performance boost would be the M4 Pro or Max but really don't want to upgrade to something already being replaced.  I do want to replace it with a Macbook Pro, but will wait until the M5 Pro or Max or whatever they end up calling it is out.

    Original: @DrAliToma  Its a thinkpad p14s with AMD Ryzen 8840HS with eGPU 4070 Super. Performance was very good with Win 11 22h2/23h2 until upgrading and clean installing to 24/25H2 garbage release. Its the seventh time reinstalling everything and loss of time. The old windows 10 PC with 6700HQ and 980M 8G can still hold up its own on premiere but resolve free 19/20 made it unusable so made me upgrade.
On Linux, its better but managing nvi driver after every kernel upgrade is a mess.
I simply switched from Resolve to Premiere Elements because its a stutter fest in edit page and exporting it caused massive memory leaks even on latest version.
That NPU and all the AI features are causing major hiccups and AMD drivers for NPU choke the system if there's constant heavy memory and IO involved throwing a dxgi error. The drivers and firmware are pathetic for a band aid Windows 11 as a 25+ year windows user as a kid.

That said, x86 is still more appealing to me at this time. When Apple eventually drops support, you basically have a brick. With an x86 based laptop, you have SO many alternatives that you could easily run this for a decade or more if you really wanted to, and you aren't locked into a single OS. Plus no compatibility issues, even if this is increasingly becoming less of a concern on ARM based laptops as time progresses.

    Original: ​@Atulya_Chaudharythat's false. 16GB is 16GB. All the CPUs have dynamic usage which isn't unique to Apple. Once you exceed 16GB, the SSD is used to help. Using the SSD for RAM tasks is a way to degrade it faster. All SSDs have a limited amount of writes and eventually, they will fail. Especially a problem on devices that have them soldered on. Another problem Apple has is the new Glass interface. That's not optimized, that actually uses more RAM, CPU usage, and battery.

Original: This video is comparing a 2025 M5 MBP with a slew of 2026 Panther Lake releases. It would make more sense to see what the 2026 MBP is priced at before calling the M5 MBP a bargain. Alternatively, compare the M5 MBP with Arrow Lake laptops - it will stop looking like a bargain. The machine is great - it is not and will never be a bargain.

Original: My biggest problem is that when it comes right down to it, Apple's optional pricing is borderline CRIMINAL - and this was BEFORE the current DRAM-ageddon crisis; I can only imagine what it's going to be with prices spiraling out of control. Anything above 512GB of storage is insane compared to what you would be able to get for typical PC laptops - if you could even replace it, thanks to it being soldered on the board now. This goes all the way back to the days when you could still upgrade the memory yourself with off the shelf SO-DIMM's. My 2007 MacBook Pro was such a case. It came with 2GB of RAM, and the 4GB upgrade was $200, IIRC. I ended up looking for the same spec memory on Newegg (PC2 5300) and got the 2x2GB memory modules for $100 ( if it supported more than 4GB, I would have gladly gotten it). After my warranty expired, I also ended up replacing the HDD (it was a standard 2.5" mechanical drive back then), which unlike the memory, was not "user serviceable". This basically meant that you were opening parts of the laptop that normal people weren't supposed to touch.

Anyway, if involved  removing the keyboard panel with 8 tiny screws around the edges of the laptop, carefully lifting it to disconnect the thin ribbon cable, then pulling out the small isolated shell that contained the hard drive. I ended up replacing the included 200GB HDD with a 512GB model, where I was able to dual boot it with Windows 7 via Boot Camp. Total cost? Roughly half of the price of the 320GB upgrade.

I got a refurbished Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9 model two years ago with 32GB of memory and 236GB NVMe drive that I replaced with a 2TB model for about $130. The only thing I sacrificed was getting the faster of the two i5 processors over one of the available i7's, but I honestly can't tell over the X1 that I used for work prior to that; it still runs like a champ. Not bad considering I paid $500 plus the $130 for the larger drive.

BTW, if you really want to see what's more expensive, configure that MAcBook Pro with the same 32GB of memory and 1TB of drive space, then let's talk - I won't be surprised if that MacBook is $2,500+, making that Dell XPS seem like "the bargain".

    Original: @brandonw1604 They usually give you about three years of full support and maybe two more for security updates. But in my experience, even hitting that three‑year mark was rough and full of problems. Developing for macOS makes it worse—updates often break or slow down your existing code, so you end up fixing things constantly instead of moving forward. And when the software is expensive, rolling back isn’t really an option with the same team, which means you’re stuck paying for costly repairs and upgrades.
    Sentiment: negative (confidence 0.86)

    ↳ ✅ @Marko-nx9eq  👍3  2026-02-15
    Original: @AbhishekVaid On Windows, backward compatibility is almost a badge of honor. You can still run drivers or apps that officially “expired” years ago, and they’ll usually work fine. That’s why you can get away with using 2012 drivers on Windows 12 without issues. Microsoft bends over backwards to keep old stuff running, even if it’s clunky.
Apple takes the opposite route. When you jumped from Mojave to Catalina, all 32‑bit apps were instantly dead. No workaround, no fallback. And then with the ARM transition, tons of Intel‑based software broke or slowed down, even with Rosetta 2 trying to bridge the gap. Apple basically forces you to move forward, whether you’re ready or not.

Even now, x86 is only technically supported on Windows because even modern CPU's have physical x86 hardware in them, which is one of the things that makes them more power hungry than ARM for example. Windows for ARM has the same x86 doesn't work here "problem" that Macs do for the same reasons. It has to be emulated, it isn't native.

Apple let you support both at the same time just like they did when they moved from PowerPC to Intel back in the day, with "Fat Binaries". Again, it's up to developers to support this or not. If what you want to run doesn't support Intel all that well then you can conclude whoever made it decided it wasn't worth the time, effort or resources to do it.

    Original: ​@CorneliusTaylor-s1u I went from windows to mac on my personal machine a few years ago and I still think MacOS has been designed by psychopaths. You are correct that there is always a learning curve to anything new and one can't just use mac like they've used windows for their whole lives, like many of us have, but I'll argue that MacOS is just objectively a poor user experience design wise. It takes a while to scour through the settings and install some 3rd party (probably paid) apps to make it usable.

Windows' utilitarian approach used to be a strong point but 11 is just a mess and microsoft is having a mental breakdown so for those reasons I'd still rather use a mac, not because I actually like it.

That said, KDE Plasma is a better designed desktop environment than either of the above, but any of the Linux desktop distros of course won't be a drop-in replacement for the masses any time soon. I have CachyOS on my home theater machine and I do prefer it to MacOS for daily use, until something spontaneously breaks and I have to whip out the "real" computer.

Original: What baffles me is how Windows laptops have basically brought this upon themselves. They had 5 years to catch up with Apple Silicon Macs, yet instead Dell killed the XPS line, Asus kept struggling with Quality Control, and Microsoft... well, released Windows 11. By this point it almost feels irrational to NOT buy a MacBook instead

    Original: Windows isn't important for Microsoft any more. Not directly anyway, it makes very little of their actual revenue so they're just using it as a way to feed their other investments like slurping up everyone's data for training their crappy LLM's. It truly baffles me how CRAP Copilot actually is despite the amount and kind of data Microsoft have to train it on.

Original: Interesting to hear macOS Tahoe being... quite bad, no way around it. I installed macOS Sequoia on my PC just for some Hackintosh fun and it's just such a beautiful operating system. Apple moving it all to Liquid Glass looks like throwing something out the door long before it's ready just because they needed something new to release urgently as they didn't have anything special to release otherwise. I guess they'll fix it, of course, but right now, Liquid Glass everywhere feels more like a beta release rather than a finished product ready for mass use. As for the MacBook and Mac in general, there's no comparison for tasks in which it excels, the hardware quality, power and efficiency is on a different level altogether. Far too expensive for any RAM and storage upgrades, though, Apple is raking in some seriously massive amounts of cold cash in profits there.

    Original: They are not premium, though, so it's a poor comparison. Compare with the Dell XPS and Surface Laptop, both of which are premium. Of course, there will be mid-range laptops that are cheaper, but that is not a like-for-like comparison. Apple has the MB Air at $800, which competes with cheaper Windows machines. It appears you do not understand basic retail business.
