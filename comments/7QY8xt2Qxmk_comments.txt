The MacBook Pro M4 is 1349 on Amazon so the only MacBook Air variant that makes sense to get is the 16/256 base variant.

    ↳ @flxing42  👍13  2025-10-18
    Unless you really like the lighter weight of the M4 Air

I really don't want to buy a MacBook Air because of the notch.

[3] @seacow1970  👍0  2026-01-14
I think M4 Air is best for me. I just entered the details of  my 2019 MBP and apple said they will give me upto 170 quid. I might as well keep it then! I won't get a better (spare) laptop for that. I moved to m4 mini recently, but really covet the M4 Air in black. However, I think I will wai for a bit and see what the new Air is like later on.

1000 nits is not twice as bright as 500 nits.

You don’t need a 70W charger to use the M4 chip at maximum capacity. The maximum power draw of the M4 chip is way less than 70W and Apple Silicon laptops run at full power even on battery. Not only that, but the M4 in the Air will thermal throttle after a few minutes of sustained load and will draw even less power.

    From a physics perspective, the author is still right: twice as much. But from a human perspective, it's an logarithmic increase, only about 1.3 times as much 😊

I was considering buying an 13 inch 24 GB 1000GB storage Macbook Air, but...I already own a quite good enough Lenovo Legion laptop, so at least for the moment I will not consider Apple laptop. Though I am considering and struggling to decide for a tablet (base iPad, Air or 11 inch Pro or 13 Inch Pro). For the moment I am still thinking and checking reviews.

    ↳ @zoltaczka420  👍0  2025-11-28

[14] @Sayitlikeitis1234  👍0  2025-11-25
Stop posting bullshit. The 15 inch is $949 currently at best buy. The 13 inch is the cheaper one. Plus if you have a Best Buy visa you can get this for 24 months interest free. Puts it exactly at $43.90 a month with the tax

I love every aspect of this MacBook Air except the keyboard. The keys feel cheap compared to the rest of the machine, and some of them are wobbly out of the box for me. This is driving me nuts, as I expect the keyboard quality to match the premium feel of the device.

    ↳ @brinraja  👍1  2025-11-29
    Totally agree. Switched from an 8 yo Lenovo Yoga and the keyboard feels so cheap and trash on my Macbook Air. However, the trackpad is phenomenal.

    ​@polum it ISN'T slightly better but for average person just don't get a pro. You'd think you'd actually use it for extremely power hungry stuff but in reality you really wont use it for stuff like that.

    ↳ @RainGreenPortable  👍1  2025-10-31
    ​@lildvl10 You're gonna use it just to watch streams and basic stuff? Better get an iPad at that point lol. Get an M1/M2 Macbook Air since they're really cheap now if you're using it for watching streams and stuff.

I promise you I’ll find multiple security vulnerabilities in that shite code within one hour

    ↳ @Combat-Janitor  👍1  2026-01-04
    ​@Mike-Oxlong-XXLLiterally the first thing I said out loud when watching that. I have little concerns about ai tooling itself, but rather how much confidence non-technical people have in them.

Either through a failed audit, or worse, a lawsuit from a data breach, these people are gon' learn.

    ↳ @Mike-Oxlong-XXL  👍0  2026-01-04
    @C@Combat-Janitorhe issue is that what you described already happened many times now.

Non technical people won’t learn. They’re like a donkey with low IQ  busting their foot on the same stone 100 times, never learning.

Part of the responsibility is also with channels like these that pretend there are no security implications and that everything is fine.

I work for an AI company during my dau job, but when I mention security to non technical people I am considering to be a narcissistic, know it all with a negative view on the world 🙄

guys those of you looking at these reviewers the idea that the mb air is simply good enough for a basic user is simply an ignorant incomplete thought (no offense) but the mack book air can do so many kind of developing editing and desktop tasks that its more than enough for 99 percent of people due to the fact that even lowered versions are punching way up their respective levels

    ↳ @7secondhero842  👍1  2025-12-29
    Yeah, a lot of reviewers need to be more accurate. Even this guy saying “It’s good for some light tasks” like- yes? And it’s also good for heavier tasks too besides the really really heavy workloads

theres really no reason to overspend on storage on Macbooks when you can get a Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSD at 1 TB of storage and an M.2 Enclosure to Thunderbolt for less than 100 dollars, which is better than spending the high price of only getting an extra 256 gigabytes of internal storage at 200 dollars extra.

    ↳ @Speedyvampir2  👍0  2025-12-20
    Exactly my thought

    ↳ @ethanjennings6442  👍2  2026-01-12
    This is true if your storage is filled up with content like photos or video clips for editing. But if you've filled it full of apps/programs it can be a pain.
512gb is the minimum if you're using the MBA for software development.

dont macOS is smooth, stable, and well‑integrated with Apple devices, but it comes with clear weaknesses: it’s expensive, limited to Apple hardware, offers far less customisation than Windows, and has weaker gaming support with many titles unavailable. It also struggles with certain specialist or Windows‑only software, lacks touchscreen options, and gives power users less freedom to modify or upgrade their system. On top of that, the trackpad while responsive for gestures—can feel overly sensitive, inconsistent, or awkward for precise tasks, which some users find frustrating compared to traditional mouse control.

I just can't believe people still downplay the performance on these Airs. I've got an M2 (waiting on M4 15 to be delivered next week) and it has  handled anything I have thrown at it in terms of Blender, Final Cut, Ableton, Premier Pro...etc. To say these laptops are good for "general computing purposes" is crazy work. There truly is almost no reason to get the Pro. 

Can you game? Not likely unless you are talking very small ones. Anything else? These melt faces. Whoever says they are for "general purpose computing" has lost the plot.

    Can you explain about the hard drive and flash drive ?

    ↳ @CryoXerxes  👍3  2026-01-17
    For those asking about the differences of a Flash Drive and Hard Drive, while both are a protable storage system, HOW each tech stores its files is the main difference.

Flash Drives are named so for the fact they are usually small, with a connection hardbuilt into its casing so you can just bring it out, plug it in to a proper port and it IMMEDIATLY  starts working. This makes it great for secure small scale transfers like photos, small videos, or documents too big for email.  Downside is due to the main focus being Plug n' Play, it is SIGNIFICANTLY harder to customize HOW your files are stored an who would have access on it. This combined with the fact they come with combatibility software for most operating systems means its essentially a digital basket that is hard to organize. But in almost all caaes the internal componetnts of a flash drive tend to be smaller than an egg yolk, so companies can make a ton of custom shells for fairly cheap and thats a big selling point. 

External Hardrives on the otherhand are as the name implys, similar to your own Computer's hardrive but on the outside. This means you get all the same functionality of say your C:: drive limited only by the quality of your computer's connection ports and cabeling. They tend to be on the larger size usually about the same to up to twice the size of a standard gaming mouse, which makes portablility and cable management challenge at times. But with EHDs and a bit of know-how  you can store your entire gaming system on it without bloating your main computer systems and allows you to better streamline how your computer's resources get allocated.

Both have their own pros and cons but are not easily interchangable.

regarding the transfer process around 6:30, you guys always choose to overcomplicate this.  I've owned 4 MacBooks over the last 5 years and never once have I had to use the transfer/migrate process.  All of your files, your desktop and everything is stored via the cloud.  When you sign into a new Mac with your Apple ID all of that stuff just magically appears over the course of a day and stays there.  This is what I've done every single time I got a new MacBook.  Basically just signed in and it took care of mirroring the new MacBook to my old MacBooks.  Not sure why you people complicate the process.  And no, I don't pay for some expensive cloud plan either, I'm pretty sure I have the. most basic/cheapest cloud storage plan (idk, it's like 2.99 a month).

Just upgraded from the M2 air to the M4 today. Main reason is because my M2 had 8GB of RAM and It would slow down when I'm editing videos or pics. not often but it was still noticeable.

    Yep. I decided to pull the trigger on my first MacBook because it was such a good price. It MIGHT be less expensive on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but I didn't want to take the chance and it's hard to see that it would be discounted more or if it is, I doubt it will be by much. It's already back to $999 just the day after I bought mine. $749 is a steal. I love this thing. It seems so solid, especially compared to any of the Windows PCs I've owned.

I was going to go with the base MacBook Air M4 on sale on Amazon for $749, but I opted for the the $200 512GB SSD upgrade (from base 256GB), which is also faster (2800 vs 4100 write speed) and with any upgrade you also get free the $100 processor upgrade from 8-core GPU to 10-core GPU.   The need for app and video file storage space was why I chose the 512GB upgrade, but the included GPU upgrade helps with the 8K video editing I deal with for 360 videos.

    you can, all depends on what your editing, if your editing in PR and AE at the same time, with an hour long timeline... no, but if your making short form content your def good

MBA only needs a right side thunderbolt port, 4TB SSD option (although I do not want to know what apple would charge for it) and nanotexture or equivalent matte display. 

I don't need 120hz (it'll only kill battery) and I don't need OLED with PWM-issues and added battery drain. 100% adobe RGB is nice but I doubt they'd achieve that without going OLED.

That will be my new mac. Though my M1 MacBook Pro is not doing too bad for 5 years old. It's insane.

    same :)

    Same. My M1 with 8GB is a champ for 90% of things I do. 
It only drags when doing two 32” screens but that’s because the M1 can’t natively do 2 displays. 
It’s a must for me.

I absolutely love the 15" MacBook Air - It's my daily driver for everything work and personal.  I also have a 16" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and it's fantastic as well ... but I hate traveling with it.  It's a bit chunky and the extra weight is tiresome when it's in your backpack all day long.  Performance wise, the M4 can outpace the M1 Pro in all of my workloads, even web development using C++ and Web Assembly.  If you set your projects up right - incremental builds are fast and painless.  It's a developer thing - mostly working single files at a time, needing quick bursts of performance to compile them in the scope of a larger project.  And for those larger projects my MacBook Air is MAXED OUT with 32 GB of Unified Memory and 2TB of storage.  Most people will opt for the faster processors and better graphics of the MacBook Pro, but I would much rather get more Storage.  That second TB is costly at $400, but it's so nice not packing an external drive - just grab it and go.
