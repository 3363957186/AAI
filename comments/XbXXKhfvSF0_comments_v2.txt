原文：Get yourself a dedicated player instead of your phone for music if you're doing high-res audio and pair these with it. Of course, if you're using your phone to play your music, you don't care about sound quality and would be better off with sub $50 headphones

原文：I’ve had both the WH-1000XM4 and the WH-1000XM5 headphones, and unfortunately, I’ve had the same issue with both of them. The left headband hinge tends to break after 2 or 3 years. While Sony is known for its excellent noise canceling technology, I’m hesitant to buy more from them due to this recurring problem. Additionally, the right hinge on the XM5 broke loose just a year after purchase.

    原文：@Sh4kkiwell not for me, I travel a lot and I value noice cancelling performance. I have tried Focal and Sennheiser and whatever the sound quality over Sony is negated by their poor ANC. For me the Bathys are in the no man’s land. At home I don’t care for ANC so I go for even better headphones and for travel I prioritize ANC.

    ↳ ❌ @PimpmasterMcGooby  👍0  2025-05-16
    原文：@Sh4kki "Anything below 70% is safe", what a dangerous statement. Anything below 70decibels is safe, with increased volume gradually shortening how long it's safe to listen. And a sidenote, my Bathys were over 80db at around 30%, and since it's powered by the same internal Amp, my 30% should be as loud as your 30% with them, so 70% is absolutely damaging your hearing.

[29]  @desmondbrown5508  👍0  2025-06-24
原文：Yeah I'm going to go ahead and say, regarding Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra that they outright kind of ruined them vs. Quiet Comfort II.  It is a software mess that randomly just quit connecting to my phone so I couldn't even update them anymore.  And for some reason will only connect to my PC now.  And they feel worse than the Quiet Comfort II's.  It's weird because QC II's were (and honestly still are afaik -- haven't ever tried XM6's) the best feeling headphones ever, but for some reason the buttons on QC Ultra (the supposed upgrade) are cheaper and feel worse, the on/off being a press and wait was a massive step backwards as it's delayed and doesn't always work vs. the snappy response of the switch that just works every single time.

I'm hoping to try these new Sony's out because the ONLY thing at this point they have to beat (they already beat noise cancelling last gen) over Bose for me is to be more comfortable than the QC II's and have FUNCTIONAL connectivity unlike the buggy operation of QC Ultra.  I doubt they will be more comfortable than QC II's, honestly especially when the review mentions sweaty ears after a couple hours, but at this point with the direction Bose has went, I'd rather just have close enough headphones that sound better and have better noise cancelling and just function correctly.  I still regularly use my old QC II's, and they still sell new ones, but I feel like the later batches have had their sound driver deliberately destroyed.  Tested a new pair (after being disappointed with QC Ultra) and they just sound worse than my earlier pair of QC II's.  I guess artificial downgrade to make people want the QC Ultra?  Not sure.

原文：On the price I'd say that manufacturers have both squizzed the middle men (shops and various distributors) and enlarged margins because when you can, well, why don't you. The good thing is that at that price, some of us will think twice before renewing an already very good headset. Maybe that'll help the environment a tad 🙂

原文：I have the MX5's and they have been good to me. Except the plastic around the hinge on the right side fractured and now the ear phone on that side just dangles by the internal wires. They still work, just the swivel hinge snapped after normal use. The cup design creates pressure onto the ear and that leveraging stress was too much for the cheap brittle plastic. You can tell that the MX5's swivel was an engineering flaw because the MX'6 reinforced the swivel hinge with metal. Can anyone offer advice on how to get my MX5's repaired or replaced? Also is there anyone with hands on experience able to confirm that the MX6's swivel design is more robust and durable? Thanks!

A lot of chatter and even the sounds of cars driving by in the distance still get through... Is this supposed to be normal or just my first experience with noise cancelling headphones.  P.S. I have never used noise cancelling anything ever before. And the times the noise gets through is when i am not listening to anything on the headphones. I just leave the noise cancelling turned ON . Is this normal ?

原文：the WH-10000xm5 were the worst set of headphones ive ever owned by far. the sound and comfort was amazing,  but the shear mount of "smart" features they had absolutely imploded the listening experience. want to adjust your earmuffs to fit comfortably? music will pause for 10 seconds when touching them.. want to sing while listening to your music? music will pause for 10 seconds thinking your "talking" to them.. full of stupidity like this.. i strictly used these listing to music on my pc and there was no windows software to fix these issues. i could download an app on my "smart" phone, but that would require disconnecting from my pc, and pairing with my phone via Bluetooth (hopefully works)... once connected i was FINALLY able to disable some of these ridiculous "smart" features... BUT, the most infuriating part was that these headphones would auto update often, resetting all the "smart" features back ON, EVERY. SINGLE.TIME!!!  NEVERAGAIN!!!

Imagine, audio being automatically cut-off the moment you start speaking  (at times even if you take a deep sigh). So,  when your co-worker responds you have no idea what they said -till you basically decide to not use the headphones (after apologizing profusely for "technical" issues 🙄🙄)

And yes you can disable it - but believe it or not Sony automatically keeps on enabling it 🤦🏽‍♂. Super annoying feature making the headphones almost useless for taking office calls!

原文：i'm honestly surprised that Marques spoke so highly of these since he travels a LOT and seems to always be on multiple flights every week.  He mentioned that these headphones (and pretty much all other Sony headphones) "make your ears sweat after a couple of hours wearing them".  I'm sure the majority of his flights will last longer than 2 hours, so I personally can't imagine wearing sweaty headphones for that long.  Like most people, when I "demo" headphones, I play certain songs that I'm familiar with looking for specific notes and nuances of familiar tracks.  But lets face it, most headphones north of $300 sound quite nice.  For my wife and I, we travel extensively worldwide (most flights are 10+ hours long) and the only headphones for us that deliver exceptional sound, incredible noise cancelling and phenomenal comfort WITHOUT any ear sweat is Bose.   You almost had me with these, until you mentioned the sweat factor, and I just shook my head again.  I will stick with my Bose knowing I can wear these as long as I want with comfort, excellent sound quality and world class noise cancelling.

原文：I was hoping at least Marques would mention it. But for some reason it seems all reviewers fail to mention the adaptive ANC which cripples the performance. For some reason Sony, and now Bose with the Ultra gen 2, fail to allow you to disable the adaptive ANC. 

And I am strictly talking about the adaptive part. I want the ANC to be at full strength at all times. But it seems these companies know better and want to think for you. It's absolutely horrible and ruins these "premium" headphones. All they need to do is add a toggle in the app to disable it. Why they refuse to do so blows my mind. And why reviewers casually gloss over this also blows my mind, as it was the first thing I immediately noticed upon trying the headphones.

原文：I've come from the XM4s and in comparison, they're only OK, not much better, I principally use them outdoors while doing my 10000 steps listening to Audiobooks, the sound quality is duller then the XM4s and the the responsiveness of the automatic noise cancelation outdoors is useless, it's best to turn the feature off, unless you like amplified wind noise.
BUT they are lighter then the 4s and more comfortable to wear while pounding the pavements. I'm not returning them, but I'm still keeping the 4s for music listening.

He had to sell them because they were uncomfortable on his head
The straps are too thin
They dig into his scalp
Informative, respectful feedback from HIS perspective

原文：The only issue with Sony's is that, since the XM5 iteration, earcup size has been reduced, for big ear guys like me they are a big no, they aren't as comfortable and do not isolate as well, which is pretty much the point of an ANC system. So, saying they are the best is a big stretch when taking into account other factors which are just as important. So, for the average joe, they could very well be the best, but not for every case.

BTW, Sony has ALWAYS been obsessed with BASS.. remember their MEGA BASS switches on their CD and Cassette players? I REALLY hated it.. I'm not a BASS fan. I got these XM6 on a promo for $180US (for people who sells these for a living) and would NEVER buy these at full price for $450US, 100% not worth it and it feels like cheap plastic. These things are worth at best $200US. Maybe I'm spoilt since I have access to a lot of high end headphones but honestly these are not worth full retail. If I was to pay full retail for a pair of headsets then I'd probably get the Bose QC Ultra but I'm happy with the XM6 for the price I paid (almost third of retail). All I can see is not much has changed in the headphone world since the original XM1 and QC45 ..

Read many ppl online have the same problem, dont trust that XM6 wont have these problems for sure. Dont wanna risk it.

Switched to Bowers&Wilkins PX8, sounds better, has almost as good noise cancellation, better clamp force, looks better, is more durable and made of better materials, doesnt have any of the aforementioned problems.

Highly recommend

    ↳  @lbnyrider5666  👍0  2025-06-02
    原文：@northsideshortyYes, I purchased them that day, delivered following week because I wanted the silver color. 
But just as the XM4, incredible sound but with MUCH better noise cancellation. With only moderate volume level and noise cancellation on, the outside world is absent. So for example at gym, don’t hear any loud banging of metal weights from other, or stomping feet on treadmills, or the gym music. 
There is more room for your ear inside the ear cuff, and just generally more comfortable. 
It is notably faster in connecting to devices than the xm4. 
Honestly as of right now the only two minor downsides I can think of is that it doesn’t say “power on… Power off” when turning on and off. It just makes that little dull thump sound, even when disconnecting from a device. So sometimes unsure if I turned it on or off. 
And the other is that it connects to multiple devices automatically. So if I want to use it on my computer and I turn on and hit connect it will, but will then also automatically connect to my phone. But sound is coming from my computer but then if I’m scrolling through my phone and try to hear the sound, it’s not coming from phone or headphones, so then I have to disconnect my Bluetooth for a second. So that’s annoying. 

So if you are in need of new headphone, I highly recommend. I just prefer Sony sound profiles over many others, Bose is my second. 
I use them for music, TV, Gaming and work calls.

    原文：Some people are saying that the "cafe mode" feature is pointless because lo-fi tracks exist, but let me make a good point that turns the tables, it's a very obvious point to make and highlights why that idea is more less wrong, and kinda stupid.

First off, I've listened to Lo-fi music before on my Sony XM5's, and straight up, it does not sound like I am in a cafe, so you either have questionable hearing, or poor awareness, I dunno, your pick. Second, you do know that speakers and headsets can fire sound in slightly different directions if support for such a feature is coded into the software, right? 

Lastly, this is not the reason someone is buying these😂 But who know's? For instance, I'm going to try this feature, but I am more excited by the fact that they actually brought back the OG collapsable design, managed to make ANC better, and the sound is better too, which brings me to another point.

NO, EQ can NOT make your headset sound the same, why? Because it's not the EQ that is the main character here, it is, once again, the drivers in the headset. Depending on your drivers, certain EQ settings can actually make it sound worse because your drivers cannot accurately recreate the frequencies you are hoping for, and sometimes it works, but it can sound muddy. So the fact they were able to improve the drivers makes a big difference from the already amazing XM5's, Is a surprise because corporations like Sony usually barely change anything in their products. I Remember watching reviews on the XM5's, and tech channels were using the flat, base EQ. This means they listened to them the way they sound out of the box, so there is no bias, and they were right because my experience matched what they were talking about.

So anyway, I will hopefully be getting mine, and I hope I am not wrong here. Good thing I can always hit that return button and explain things that might make Sony try harder next time. Thank God sound is one of the harder things to fake, because of how "fragile" sound waves can be, especially when it's coming from a very small space.

It’s like they give you high quality and close and loud speakers, then give an option to not use them, to make you feel like it’s a distant noise. A low budget echo or a normal phone on low volume can give you the same effect; as that’s exactly how cafe music works. It’s a music system on low volume which isn’t near your ear. So at this point you could just play your music on a speaker far away, rather than buy a high volume high quality speaker to not use them

原文：the sound since the XM3 has been pretty awesome. BUT I had the 3, and 4. and randomly there is this SQUEELING noise for no reason. I tried ALL the fixes online and nothing works. Super frustrating. Until this is fixed its totally unacceptable for a flagship headphone.

原文：My XM3s finally broke about a month ago and I've been going back and forth on the XM6s or Airpods Max.  I heard it'll be a while until Apple releases the actual v2 of the Airpods Maxes so I don't know if I want to wait.  Only thing I didn't like about the Sony's were the vegan leather ear cups.  I'll probably just go with the XM6s though.

With a rocker for volume up/down that doubles down as skip or previuos if long pressed and a play/pause button (both of these could fit on the "blank" side), you have covered 99.9% of usecases

    原文：I have a love-hate relationship with them. They sound and feel great, but have a ton of software issues. There's been so many times I wanted to throw them out because of the speak to chat mode constantly turning on, the headphones randomly stopping working and not turning on, the headphones disconnecting on windows VERY often especially when switching media. Also sometimes hearing electrical component noise in one of the earpads. Maybe I just have a bad pair, but the list of issues is just too long...

    原文：@aurelisdnb TBH I have disabled most of the useless functions. I believe them to be in the favor stable connections over quality (I need big range when gardening). I had controller/headphone issues with my window desktop until I connected the proper antennas and that fixed the problem, without them it's all crap. BUT, if you hear those noises, there is a real possibility that your pair is either defective or a bit broken due to hits, water/sweat or other damage that may be occurred and that may explain the bad connection too

    原文：@VibhavSinha Mine used to do that (right headphone only) with noise cancelling on. If I recall correctly it has to do with a feedback loop due to one of the mics getting dirty or something like that. There are videos on YT of how to fix it. The sound truly is ear shattering though so I understand your hesitation to wear them after.

原文：I am not sure whether Marques has actually used the QC Ultras for an extended period of time, but there's no universe in which they're flat out "better" than the XM5s or XM6s. For one, I find the sound quality is not even comparable (Bose beats these by a very wide margin), and the ANC is a lot better in many cases. I have both the XM5s and the QC Ultras.

As for others, comparing these to Sonos, JBL, and Beats (Beats, really??) yeah, of course the XM6s are better because they're not in the same league.

The XM5s are def comfier to wear, but I was fairly disappointed with the sound quality coming from the 3s. Maybe I was just way too used to the 3s, or maybe there was something off about the referbished ones, but part of me still wished I saved off for the 6s lol.

    原文：Using the aux cable sounds bad unless you also power them up so the battery still gets used. Mine are still going strong and survived being submerged in coca cola, they're bomb proof. Well the plastic snapped and I fixed them with black tape a few years ago, still no reason to ever get a newer version. They're the best product I've ever got. Also got them for $50 on ebay in 2019 with the plastic already snapped, didn't matter at all, tape fixed in ten seconds. The new ones look worse also

    原文：​@GRamerDimI just looked it up, and sadly when the battery goes the bypass feature is gone. It's quite possible it uses less battery I don't doubt that and so maybe that's prolonging the life of the product. But it's still ultimately a consumable within your replaceable battery so it's not a long-term option. Eventually the xm3 lovers will have to find an alternative. If you have some older stuff that legitimately has quadruple a solutions you can keep them for much longer. Hassle of course having to rely on the batteries and it's not cheap but it is nice to know that they're not completely waste to after 5 or 10 years

原文：There is absolutely no way these are any good. Every time I use a pair of headphones that gets a glowing review they suck so hard and hands down are the worst for phone calls... They have sharp loud jaring system sounds. They fucking cost more than everyone else and they are worse. This has to be paid sponsorship along with any other Sony headphones review.

原文：A big design flaw of the XM4's that I never see mentioned is that while the touch controls can be disabled, the beeping noise it plays in the headphones when it registers a touch CANNOT be turned off. 
I commute by train and it's something to do with the electrical fields that causes the touchpad to constantly register touches.
I contacted Sony about this and it's "working as intended".
I the end, the only way to fix it was to open up the headphones and physically disconnect the touch pad cable.
Can the touchpad can be fully disabled on the XM6?

原文：To the product manager: Sony please listen carefully, I just purchased the WH-1000XM6 headphone, the extender adjustment feels cheap and isn't intuitive or smooth when adjusting. I don't know why you're going backwards, the noise canceling has been reduced it's weaker than the predecessors. Sound quality is excellent and the EQ overall is excellent but you need to work on the extender adjustment and the noise canceling. And it is not comfortable to wear at all it puts way too much pressure on my head. In my opinion the WH-1000XM2/3/4 had the best adjustment method and the absolute best noise canceling system especially the XM4's, maybe it has to do with the on-ear versus the over ear cups. Also, was the most comfortable to wear and to personalize in terms of adjustment and comfort. From one Sr. Product Director to another, this is the best decision Sony can make. Unfortunately I'm returning the headphones back to Best Buy. Sony is a phenomenal brand and I don't want the word "cheap" or  "backwards" to be associated with the brand. I have so much respect for the brand. That's why I reached out.

原文：I really really hope they'll add the Clear Bass option found in the eq settings for the WF 1000XM5 also on the WH 1000XM6. I just can't get a proper bass on the XM6s. The WF 1000XM5 are superior at least when it comes to listening to EDM, in my opinion.
Maybe they fix this for the XM6s in a future update 🙏

原文：Sound is trash now. 30mm speakers for a 500$ headphone is a joke. Especially for one that needs to cancel noise. That's too much pressure on one small speaker. And you can tell. The bass is no longer there. No where near the xm3. It has peaks and dips all over the frequency response. So you can't even argue they sound balanced. It's just bad. They need to bring back the 40mm drivers that took the throne. Not these money grab gimick trash cans.

原文：My XM4s started making a high-pitched noise just after a year of use—conveniently right after the warranty expired. Took them to a repair shop, and while it worked for a while, the issue came back after three months. Pretty disappointing for such a premium pair. Makes me question whether it’s even worth spending the money on the XM6.

原文：Reviews of these often neglect the voice recognition for things like battery status.  You can say “hey headphones battery check” and it will tell you the battery level.  Many other commands also.  Additionally, the auto power off and actually having a power switch is great.  I have the AirPods Max which lack this features and feels much more uncomfortable the then Sony.  Nice to go quickly into transparency mode by just holding my hand over the right side speaker to hear an announcement etc is great.

I think that was due to the refurbish as its the same side that the repair was seemingly done.

XM5s are more durable from less moving parts, but of course not foldable!

原文：The biggest strength of Sony headphones is their LDAC connection, which is not available on iphones. If you have an iPhone, you aren't getting the full value out of these. I would even go so far to say that if you have an iPhone, there's really no point in buying expensive Sony headphones, and you should probably get something like the Air Max (or whatever it was called) which allows for better quality connections with iphones. 

If you're on Android, make sure you enable the LDAC connection and also use a high quality music source.

Don't get me wrong; I have loads of LDAC gear and use it when necessary for my Arya Stealth, but even then I'm really doing it just because it's there, rather than any perceived difference.

原文：I still have got my xm5s, and one issue that stands out from the beginning of me using them is that transparency mode sounds kind of bad. Like you can obviously hear voices and what not, but the quality of the sound is downgraded, and that sometimes makes me not hear things which ticks me off. Glad they fixed that in the xm6s.

I can buy two pairs of WH-1000-XM4s for the price of one pair of XM6s. Which do you think is better value for money? There's no way in hell that the XM6s are €270 odd euros better than the XM4s. Not even close. I guess the old adage of fools and money being easily parted is the new mission statement at Sony.

原文：lol the one thing that annoys me with my XM5s is that they heat up, and it sounds like that is the one thing they haven't updated!

I think it might be worse because I have a big head, so they are maybe tighter on me than on some others.

Not that I'd really have the budget to upgrade frivolously anyway, I bought the XM5 in the first place because I view good noise cancelling headphones as just basic accessibility for being autistic and wanted something durable with a case as well. The hope is I'll get my moneys worth before they inevitably someday break and I have to get whatever the current gen is.

I don't think the audio quality on them is all that bad, but changing the EQ setup is a requirement. Some good suggested settings still floating about I imagine. I wonder how many people complaining about audio quality never touched the EQ.

    原文：Using them at home every day and they're comfy all day long. Sound is great and noise cancelling is nice when there is distracting outside noise or neighbors are loud. Most of the time I don't even use ANC cause the passive NC does a good job by itself. Battery lasts at least 2 full days with a mix of ANC on/off and just charging it for 5 minutes makes it last for a couple hours.

    原文：@seya_2  That's the downside of all the wireless crap we buy today.  If you're in the Apple garden they you're screwed since you can't easily use their products in wired mode without some adapter.  I use my Bose QC25 (wired only) on planes with Samsung Android tablets on planes that have real audio jacks.  It sounds better than my XM4 Sony in wireless NC mode.

The side button randomly taps so much that I've had to permanently disable it and yes restarting the system does help but then it just eventually happens again and Sony won't fix it/deny that there's an issue. Also the speak function sucks and goes off when you cough so I've disabled that as well. But overall they're still good.

Maybe I just got a bad unit, but literally every function I bought these headphones for isn't working properly.

Build quality is really bad, rattles and squeaks.
The fit could be way better, every time I move my head or even when the train shakes from left to right slightly the ANC gets super glitchy and doesn't properly recover unless turned off and on again, imbalance between L/R and a hand full of other complaints.

Returned it within two months of purchase because of how bad these problems seemed to get.

We each have the Bose QC Ultras now which feel like a soft pillow on our head and ears compared to Sony. 
It's too bad because we loved our Sony XM3's and the battery life with Sony is definitely better than Bose but the XM5's felt like a torture device so we're now a Bose household until Sony designs a much more comfortable headphone.

    原文：Watching this in late 2025 and the XM4 is still the GOAT.. at least for me. 

The fact that Sony brought the folding hinge back for the XM6 just proves the XM4 design was right all along. 
You get 90% of the performance for half the price. (Putting fresh earpads helps)."

State of Sony headphones in 2025:
XM6 ($450): Great, but expensive. Proof that folding headphones are superior. 
XM5 ($350): The awkward middle child. Doesn't fold, huge case.
XM4 ($200): The Value King. Still top-tier ANC and sound for nearly half the price. Great value, classic foldable design, and punchy bass.

If you own XM4s, you're not missing out. You're just saving money.

XM4 already supports LDAC (Sony's high-quality audio codec). 
You aren't missing out on major sound quality features by sticking with the older model.

Even in 2025, XM4 beat the XM5 on design (folding) and beat the XM6 on price. 
The XM4s are the Windows 7 of headphones.

One of the best tech investment I've made.

原文：Dear Fultime filmaker, l hope l find you well ,My name is Takunda Mukarati, Im studying IT at Midlands State University and I’m reaching out with deep respect and hope in my heart.

I’m passionate about music video direction,short films commercial production, and video editing. I’ve been working hard to build my skills and take steps toward my dream, but right now I lack the proper equipment to bring my vision to life.

I’m hoping to acquire essential gear like a professional camera, gimbals, tripods, and a powerful editing machine. These tools would help me shoot quality music videos, create compelling ads, and continue growing as a creative.

If there’s any way you could help me or point me in the right direction, I would be incredibly grateful. Even just hearing from you would mean the world to me.

Thank you for inspiring people like me all around the world to dream big and stay kind.

Sincerely,
Takunda Mukarati

I have been using this series of headphones since the WH-1000X, and with each new iteration, I purchase them. I am a headphones power user, to the point (I know it's not healthy), but I often sleep in them (Busy city outside my window). So far, the XM4 were my favourite, but the XM5 have been a very reliable partner to have. This series of headphones has been unbeatable to me. I often tried other headphones like the Bequite but this is just always a cut above. I'll be purchasing these. Thanks for the review MKB, top quality as always.

原文：These Sony headphones are pricey but after buying them, I was so surprised as it turned off all the chatter around me.  I checked out my Samsung S8 Ultra tablet's settings and clicked on Bluetooth.  Turned it on and with my headphones showing up I clicked on them and I heard  "bluetooth connected".  I had to look for my audio setting on the tablet and increased the volume but no sound ?  Just then, I realized the video wasn't playing so started the video and man was the sound was so clear but yet it doesn't feel like its directed into your ears but more like sound all around your head with no earphones on ?   Value for money, they're very light and yes your ears will get sweaty after a few hours so grab a few tissues, lift and wipe behind your ear and to the same with the other.  Suffer the pain, buy these and know these are value for money.

原文：I tried these headphones after watching this video but after 1 trip I returned them. It has some cool features but ultimately too many weaknesses to make them better than my old pair of Bose. Due to the rotation of the headphones during storage, they tend to want to revert to this twisted position while on your head, so after 2 hours of wear on a plane, one side was pressing on the front of my ear and on the other ear it was pressing toward the back. Not comfortable. This also affects its ability to effectively cancel noise because it can’t stay stationary around your ears. For the price, these are not worth it.

原文：07/08/2025 - Review of the Sony WH-1000XM6
I will be honest, I was watching the review and I was thinking was this video sponsored by Sony? The review didn't seem as genuine as it could be and the review was more targeted for an audience who plan to purchase the latest model and then purchase the next latest model that releases, not for an audience who plan to purchase and own the headphones until they break/ wear down from old age. In my opinion the new latch case will be worse in terms of longevity from the rubbing against things in a bag and then not clicking anymore. So, to put it simply, I genuinely feel that there has been a downgrade in the case design from a longevity point of view.

    原文：The problem with Bluetooth is that we still do not have any better headset protocol in the Bluetooth baseline spec than we had a couple of decades ago.

Modern Bluetooth would have enough bandwidth to *always* support 48 kHz PCM audio to the headset and mono 48 kHz PCM audio from mic to the host device. However, the protocol doesn't guarantee such protocol so device manufacturers do not create support for it.

The only thing you can trust to always work is year 1998 SBC audio which is roughly GSM phone quality.

    原文：@Atimoz Isn't it more precisely a question of codecs at this point? We have Bluetooth headphones that can receive LDAC which is 990 Kbps, so there must be a way to receive audio the quality of AAC at 320 Kbps max and emit the same quality for a mic at also 320 Kbps or slightly lower within the same bandwidth, right? Or am I missing something? Legit question btw, not tryna assume anything.

    原文：This isn't the fault of the device, it's a fault of the bluetooth standard.  It has enough bandwidth to do pretty darn good audio one way, but really bad audio two way.  This is why some headphones actually have two different modes when you look at them in your computer's sound mixer, one "headphone" and one "headset", where the headset is garbage audio quality because it's half width.  The only thing that will fix this is for a bluetooth revision with more bandwidth to become the industry standard.

It doesnt have a boom mic set up, the mic is internal without direct mouth to mic like gaming headsets, yet it is still decent enough.

    原文：@demivideos8887that is the reason, lemme tell you why thats the case.
I have airpods pro 2, their mic quality is okay to say the least, but when I am in discord or on calls where the sound has to be clear, what is do to drastically improve the sound is, cup my hand, put it in the direction of the AirPod which is using the mic, and voila, sounds (almost) like a pro mic. Try it and tell me.
The reason is, by cupping your hand you re direct the sound waves directly to your headphone’s/AirPod’s microphone.

..BUT.. the protocol for simultaneous communication and the often needs for compatibility always use like what feels like the lowest possible bandwith.. 
But it is mostly the intercompatibility.. iPhone with Airpods has great quality.. but airpods with pc for communication on things like discord are horrible.
What really grinds my gears is windows 11 not making it easy to just use the good audio quality of my airpods when any application is running that uses or tries to use the microphone.. on win10 you could just disable the "phone function" of the airpods easy.. on win 11 its quite the hassle..

After all, they are headphones for music. You can't get anywhere near the audio quality without one. The only reason these are even better than the Beat Studio pro at all is ANC. Even then the ANC in the Beats is not bad by any means. IMO

    原文：⁠​⁠@A4000When we’re critiquing the prices of these headphones and comparing them with each other to see which has more value for the price, your “hyperbole” doesn’t help determine that. 500 is a long shot from 300. Following your logic, If I ask the same question: “but is it 1000 bucks more?” I’m also being hyperbolic but also not contributing to if spending the extra cash is worth it for the latest product.

Nothing wooshed over my head; your comment simply didn’t help or rebuttal the other guys point about the XM6’s being more than 5% better. 👍

    原文：@shanksyac8826 “500 is a long shot from 300.” Yes, that’s what hyperbole is, an exaggeration for effect, with the point being does the performance/upgrades justify the difference in price. See, the actual price doesn’t matter, so even your $1000 more example would still work, because - does the performance justify the price- would still apply. If OP is correct about 95% similarity in performance (give or take) then it does not matter what the specific price is because even at half the price, it would not be worth 5% improvement. That’s how logic works, kid. 

It was never about the specific price, it’s about the ratio of money & value compared to the XM4. So, yeah, it whooshed over your head, too fast for you to catch it, Drax.

    原文：@A4000It was clear to me that you were exaggerating from the start. The point you’re missing with all this is that your sarcastic comment in the beginning didn’t contribute a single thing to the conversation. Or to the opposing point that this product doesn’t give as much value for price as the other one that was brought up. Ok, “kid”?

All of those categories were better on bose. I bought my bose on a discount for 270$. So are they actually a better choice?

原文：The real-time ANC adjusting was what made me return the XM5s. Wearing glasses was not doable with them either, due to the tiny gap from ear to headphone, and every time I would move my head, lean over, chew or talk/sing they constantly adjusted and it was always adjusting something somewhere and it drove me absolutely insane and I could not stand them and was forced to return them for that specific reason. I read your description and wanted to ask anyway, do the new XM6s do this at all, whatsoever? I work in a very noisy environment that's constantly changing noises, and my XM4s work beautifully, and I was curious about these new ones.

Thanks.

原文：My XM6's just arrived. They are not nearly as comfortable as my XM4's. There is a clamping sensation around your ears that is akin to someone cupping their hands and pressing them over your ears. The discomfort is the price of noise cancelling which is much much better. The sound is better but nothing you'll be blown away by. The call quality is much much better. 

I'm considering returning them based on comfort level. Also, I am wondering if my money might have been better spent on a pair of open backed earphones and just use my XM4's for airplane rides.
