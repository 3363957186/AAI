    "clean_text": "really appreciate your points. well full disclosure my first job was with apple and i left in 2011. i have seen apple make plastic crap and plastic tanks the unibody cnc aluminium design we have today was chosen primarily due to the heat dissipation properties. sadly, that was never used like it was supposed to. see, around this price point, whatever pcs are available are more computers. dont get me wrong, but in absolute truth an arm soc design was never meant for a full stack computer. thats why io ports are an issue. these are great with battery and almost anything. but when you really throw actual software on it not apps, application stacks the arm architecture begins to struggle. but 95 users have nothing to gain or loose there. just that during the power pc days the ibm chips used to be more capable than x86. this direction is reverse. so thats my perspective. buy what will be useful for you, thats good for all.",

    "clean_text": "well, i'd look for benchmarks, but i think there's an improvement. also, i recommend you check if 16gb is enough or you'll need more. for storage, external ssd should be a lot cheaper than upgrading it with apple. btw, remember that mbp has hdmi, sd card port, and other things that you could useneed, like mini-led panel with really good hdr. and the m4 added ray tracing cores, perhaps helping with advanced lighting simulation tasks, but i don't really know that much about editing programs hahah. also, remember that mac mini is great and cheaper, in case you already have a monitor and don't need a lot of portability. anyways, m1 is still being really good, so be sure that the improvement is worth it.",
