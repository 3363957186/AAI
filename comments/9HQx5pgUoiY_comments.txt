Would nano-texture be harder to use with a privacy screen on the MacBook Pro? Or does a privacy screen only work well with the original glossy screen?

When M1 was launched there were talks that no one cause use that much power how come now we need M4 as it is beaten the M1 and its a need now

I’m still running the original M1 Pro. It’s a little bit slow. But I have no issues in 4k raw videos even at 120 FPS shooting 95% of my footage on a canon R5. Our project folders generally average 500 GBs. I sure would love to upgrade someday. Maybe next year.

The ugly notch stands out so much they need to remove it

    ↳ @YourOwnDa  👍3  2024-11-18
    Yep, surely a bezel on the top wouldn’t look weird or asymmetrical because there’s one at the bottom near the hinge?

    ↳ @dan9700  👍1  2024-11-18
    @ also windows laptops have tiny bezels and webcams in them. Apples isn’t even that great

    ↳ @vinnyvdvici  👍0  2024-11-18
    Do you have an iPhone with a notch? I hardly ever notice the notch because apps have done a good job hiding it

    ↳ @Professor-Scientist  👍1  2024-11-18
    @vinnyvdvici yeah but it's different on a computer, if I watch a video in full screen I don't want to see a notch, I'd rather have a thicker bezel

I pulled the trigger on the M3 Max, somewhat expensive for me, it was my first laptop in many years, I had a long spell with basically nothing save for my iPhone. I would hope that the M4 isn’t that much better? It’s easy for me to feel the FOMO. Not a nano texture person.

Dk, don’t see much improvement from m1 or m2 max so I might just wait till m6 and keep my fingers crossed for something notable. It’d be cool if they threw an entry ultra chip in a newly released MacBook Pro, though, I wouldn’t know how the cooling would fare or how long the battery would last without needing a replacement in like 2 yrs.. (especially in a 14 incher)

You should have edited out the speed of the Mac especially if you're near a school zone.

    @fn9111take the video down and turn down the DJI sponsorship. take financial responsibility for his actions like any other person doing this would might be a good start.

Hell, I think just as he said it himself, he caused this himself due to the Streisand effect. He wanted to hide it so he labeled it “unnecessary footage” pretending it didn’t happen and when he blew up he edited the same comment and was finally forced to take accountability in the most pointless ways.

    @jimby812 lol you guys are ridiculous and just being Karen’s at this point . We’ve all sped before… You don’t report yourself to the police once you do that. An apology and learning from your mistakes  is more than enough, if law enforcement wants to fine him then that’s up to them, you are not law enforcement. And the sponsorship is up to him and his sponsorship, also not you. It’s like you guys are complaining just to see him take a huge L for something everybody here has done

    ↳ @thefrog414  👍12  2024-11-20

    ↳ @luca_lwls  👍2  2024-11-21
    @SirDrew800 he only said something on X, on his video it's still just that he "removed an unnecessary clip", probably hoping that people will forget and/or his bootlickers will defend him. If he was really sorry, he would have worded his comment on the original video differently or uploaded a dedicated video, instead he decided to just make a small tweet that only a fraction of his followers will see

Hi all
Asking for help/advice: 

I bought Macbook Pro 16 M4 Pro on 18.12.2024. from iStyle in Croatia (no official Apple store here) opened it and keyboard keys are slightly loose and rattley on touch.
19.12. went to iStyle and the refuse to exchange it, 22.12. went to closesest Apple store in Vienna where they aknowledge keyboard issue and sent me an email statement about it and iStyle still does not accept the claim. Escalated it with Apple support, local authorities, but they still refuse to do anything. What can I do, any ideas, advice? :(

[97] @Serjko2  👍7  2024-11-18
4.4 GHz means 4.4 billion clock cycles per second.
Let’s imagine that each cycle is like a small step or movement (for example, traveling a certain distance), so we could think of each "step" of the processor as moving 1 millimeter per cycle.
Now, imagine that 4.4 billion cycles per second equals 4.4 billion millimeters per second.
So:
4.4 billion millimeters = 4.4 million centimeters = 44 thousand meters = 44 kilometers per second.
Now, to convert this into kilometers per hour, we multiply by the number of seconds in an hour (3600):
44km/sec×3600=158,400km/h
So, if we were to "convert" 4.4 GHz into a hypothetical "speed," it would be 158,400 km/h.

Is it just me, or does the nano texture in this video appear to flatten the contrast of the screen? It somehow seems that the deep blacks seem less black. I have the normal screen on my MBP M3 Max and I'm very happy with the contrast and the deep blacks. Taking away the reflections would be very nice, but not at the expense of less contrast. But maybe I need to see it in person by the time I want to shop for a replacement.

Hi Marques. I'm a software engineer, an old time Linux enthusiast, but recently, I got to work with a client who insisted having a system that is secure and supported, he means either Windows or Mac. Since I would not touch Windows to save my life, I'm thinking of getting myself a Macbook pro... not necessarily an M4 chip, maybe an older model. Unfortunately, most content reviewing Macs are more oriented to content creation rather than software development and engineering, so I need your advice on something that works, but not an overkill... Thanks

Well GPU perf is for me not enough to upgrade. The Neural Engine stuff locally i can't really use so not worth it. The CPU perf i'm not sure if i really need it. So overall fells like not worth it.
The Perf in Xcode seems to not really get any better as it eats whatever it is there. I upgrade at most every like 7 or 10ish years and buy the latest.
For the screen i use glass protector and its totally fine. Non of these features justify for me a upgrade till they sort out there gpu which they have not in M5 and not sure they will in M6 but by the changes the made to the apis it looks like it will.

saw the M4 running Windows and performed BETTER than a gaming intel laptop. I was impressed to say the least. Apple made a leap forward with this machine. 

I’m considering upgrading from my old MacBook Pro (7 years and still performing), just because I started to run test BI tools, Anaconda for Python and a SQL database, for practice.

Still undecided to wait for an M5 release.

Now, I'm upgrading to the new 16-inch M4 Mac with 64GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.

I'm pretty excited for this. Way back in 2008 I got the macbook pro (first ever laptop), the first version where they switched from the plastic body to the full aluminum body. I used that laptop up until 2016, laptop still worked but ssd upgraded werent working. I switched to a Microsoft surface pro is 2017 and that was amazing for school using the pen in one note and have all my notes in one area, although it was great for notes it even kept up with solidworks and inventor. Going to present day, the surface is shitting the bed worse than the mac did and almost isn't functional anymore. Being out of school, I decided to get the mac pro M4 max chip version and I'm excited for it. Going to use it for music production and video editing along with rendering software. I'm excited

thanks for this. With the apple trade-in promo im completely dumbfounded on what I should do. I currently have the M1 Pro Max 19 core COU 32 Core GPU and 32gb Ram. However, given the current trade in bonus I could recoup roughly $1100 as a trade-in and upgrade. Im currently on the fence on whether it's worthwhile for either a M4 Pro with 14 Core CPU  20 Core GPU and 48GB memory for $2500 or if it would be a worthwhile trade for an M3 Pro Max w/ 14 Core CPU, 30 core Gpu and 36GB unified memory for about $2800. In terms of usage, it would be an everyday driver whilst on the road and away from my studio. There is a good amount of work in Final Cut, Logic Pro and the adobe suite of products excluding premiere. I shoot in raw and use an FX3 for most of the video content.  What would be your opinion?

I'm sure they're developing an M4 Ultra and M4 Ultra Max Pro or some other chip for the desktops. HOWEVER - Apple now has the ability to put whatever chip they want in whatever machine. At this rate, they're killing the desktop computer. I am curious to see what they might do to make them something people will want to buy over their laptops or in addition to their laptops. I just don't personally see a use case for a desktop anymore for most people when you can get the same computing power in a machine that will do both. You can hook it up to a monitor and have the desktop experience and it's a machine that can go literally anywhere you do... It might be worth investing time into less expensive displays for them at this rate.

What bothers me the most is that he doesnt even want to talk about it, like it never happened. Not even a real, sincere apology. These people think they are above the law, that they are better than everyone else. Meanwhile, an average person doing something half as reckless would face a massive fine and/or prison time. At least the comments are awesome.

    ↳ @That0neSRT  👍5  2024-11-19

    ↳ @Frostbiyt  👍2  2024-11-19
    It's a bit ridiculous to ask someone to publicly admit to a crime and draw greater attention to it (he has tweeted about it). Also, I assume that you are referring to rich people, but referring to him as "these people" is a poor choice of words.

    ↳ @elultimopujilense  👍0  2024-11-19
    ​@Frostbiyt so you are perfectly fine when people with vast amounts of money and influence break the law and put others in danger? When I make a mistake, I try to take responsibility for it, because I believe that my integrity and dignity as a human being are worth more than money. I guess you dont care about it, and you would be perfectly fine in an ologarchy, but I am not. And no, I dont think that referring to them as "these people" was a poor choice of words, when they think the rules dont apply to them. They think they are better than us, and you are enabling that behavior. That guy doenst have morals, and It seems to me by your comment that neither do you.

    ↳ @Frostbiyt  👍1  2024-11-19
    @elultimopujilense Nothing in my comment says or implies any of what you said. It's stupid to expect anyone, rich or poor, to confess to a crime. And to equate (very) reckless driving to oligarchy and the countless other, much more serious crimes rich people get away with is ridiculous too. Also, since you didn't seem to get the implication form the end of my last comment: "these people" can have racist connotations in certain contexts. Like I said, I assume you meant rich people, but using that term to refer to a black man may cause people to infer a different meaning than what I think you intended.

    ↳ @elultimopujilense  👍0  2024-11-19
    @Frostbiyt "It's stupid to expect anyone, rich or poor, to confess to a crime"  Its stupid to take responsibility for a mistake you made? that is how criminals think. Of course you dont want to take responsibility for your actions, your moral compass is broken, same as millions of people. I dont think its stupid for me to be a better person and take responsibility of my actions. Criminals think everyone is like them but there are good people in this world, even if you think its stupid.

    ↳ @Frostbiyt  👍0  2024-11-19
    @elultimopujilense Personally, I don't need punishment to understand I've done something wrong and change my behavior. If I do something wrong and consequences come, then so be it, but that doesn't mean I seek out consequences. If I hurt someone or caused tangible damage, that's a different story, but not relevant to this situation.

Anyways, he wasn't caught by the police, he was caught by the internet and was rightfully called out for it. That's already more consequences than a normal person would experience. He then tweeted an apology admitting what he did was dangerous. Assuming he learned his lesson (which we can't know for sure), that really should be the end of it.

First of all, I don’t know why, but whenever you guys compare Apple M series chips with Intel or AMD, they are always ninth gen 10th gen I hope you do the same when Intel and AMD start producing ARM chips, and you compare it with M1 chip 10 year down the road, not now Cause after 9th gen They came up with 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th and instead of 15th, they went for core ultra chips

Hi everyone.
I need your opinion regarding my choice of main device for my everyday usage.
My current main device is MacBook Pro M1 and it  has "fallen". Unfortunately just before I could resell it. ( screen turned black and tech guys said the fan is not working too)

 So that aside,
I am planning to go for MacBook Pro 14 Inch M4 base model. USD $1,599.00 on Apple store.

However I am also wondering If it's "wiser" to get either a

13 inch ipadPro base model
USD 1,299.00 on Apple store. 

or 
13‑inch (M3 chip) MacBook air, Base model
$1099 on Apple store.
or the future M4 MacBook Air ? 

Thing about the MacBook Air is that it has no FAN and ...well.. 

What I need them for
1. web graphic design - photoshop-illustrator-Figma
2. programming - doing IOT and perhaps AI soon
3. video editing
4. initially audio/music production.

Another thing is , do you guys agree that we should not wait longer than 3 years from the "launch date of a device", ( in this case, say Windows/Apple ) because the price drop would be huge and we need to take that into consideration if we'd like to to resell our device. 

For a budget of 1000USD what could be my 2nd device ? preferably Windows OS, light for travelling. ( laptop or tablet or 2 in 1 )

Thanks and happy holidays, happy new year!

    ​@BusyCasual Reputation should never be back to the same. It's easy to apologize silently every creator does this, but they are only apologizing after getting caught. There's no way this guy didn't have the mental capacity to know what he was doing was wrong before getting called out, even more in the previous video he hide it and didn't comment about it at all, he was aware it made him look bad rather than honestly thinking it was actually wrong. Plus no apology in Youtube because it is more advantageous for him that the least number of people know about it rather than doing the right thing.

He can apologize but certainly now we are 100% convinced without doubt he isn't a good person, just another greedy low morale youtuber.

6:14 if you are comparing increments as 20% or 30%, you should be using 100% for conveying double performance not 200% that would mean 3x performance

Edit: 4x -> 3x

This was really interesting, thank you! I'm a video editor but I don't have the budget to max out the specs. What would you say is the minimum specs for video editing (I edit mostly iphone 4k footage but sometimes h265 podcast footage from a camera)? 
I currently have a 2019 imac with i9 intel processor and 40gb of ram...it handles everything pretty well but does start to lag when a project has lots of 4k clips or if I'm working with long, large podcast files.

There was once when someone kicked on my laptop power cable where my laptop fell on the ground and broke. I spent few hundreds of dollars to repair the laptop. I was without a laptop for a few weeks to a month and this ripple effect to form part of the reason that I failed a university course which ripple effect cause me to suffer bad GPA which cause me to be unable to secure a good job to ripple effect cost me millions of dollars of potential future earnings and women. It’s important to protect our future generations by educating them to save their data to the cloud, use MacBook Pro with Parallels Desktop that can use Windows OS and Windows app, so they can buy second MacBook Air/Pro to continue their studies (download data from cloud and change Apple ID password) even if their first laptop is damaged deliberately or accidentally or stolen. Keep quiet. Be invisible and avoid participating in activities that don’t make you money but increase your risks of interacting with criminals.

Upgraded from an M1 base 13" MacBook Pro to a 14" M4 Pro MacBook Pro today. Night and day difference. I'm happy to go from 8GB to 24GB of RAM mainly. Plus the 120hz display. I loved my M1 MacBook Pro but the RAM limitation affected my overall confidence of longevity. The most surprising thing to me honestly is how much better the speaker array is on my new machine. Truly amazing for laptop speakers.

    ↳ @techmaster4913  👍1  2025-01-14
    Totally agree on the ram, I had an M2 MacBook Air with 8 gigs of ram and 256gb of ssd, it struggled at my school with basic tasks, the ram filled up with chrome and 2 tabs, I upgraded to the base model MacBook Pro M4 with 512gb of ssd and 16 gb of ram, huge difference in display with 120htz and being xdr with 1000 nits of brightness but mainly the ram was my biggest issue with the air I had before, I’m glad they made every Mac now 16 gigs of ram, the systems with 8 get filled up really fast, now I can keep like an extra like 6 tabs or so open

If we're being objective and honest, he wouldn't have posted that clip if he knew. No sane person wouldn't be aware of the internet backlash that would generate.

I would say if u have a MacBook Air m2 or 13 inch MacBook Pro M2 with the old touch bar design then this is actually a pretty good update, if u have the 14 inch MacBook Pro with M2 pro or M2 Max u don’t have to update, cause the 14 inch and 16 inch pros are way better than M2 air and 13 inch M2 MacBook Pro, I had the M2 MacBook Air 13 inch, it was the base model and it had ass battery life and terrible sustained performance even on my school WiFi and apps quit unexpectedly all the time and it would overheat on my lap, terrible experience I would say, i got the Base model M4 MacBook Pro and its night and day better, 

it’s way faster with M4 instead of bind Version of M2, it has 120htz promotion, outstanding battery life, a cooling system. Super fast charging, Liquid Retina XDR display with 1000 nits of brightness for regular use, hdmi ports, extra USBc ports that are thunderbolt 4, and an sd card reader, 

None of which is on the M2 air and 13 inch MacBook pro have, also if u watch Max Techs videos on the 13 inch M2 MacBook Pro, it throttles like hell and slows down since it only has 1 fan and has an absurdly outdated body that causes the cooling solution to be terrible.

Hey Marques…I really think a video explaining how the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine cores & Unified Memory impact a Laptop’s performance would be fantastic as a Tech influencer yourself!

    ↳ @LiamSchultheis  👍3  2024-11-18
    I got you:

CPU(Central Processing Unit): it calculates and processes almost everything inside the computer
GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)you’ll see this as “graphics cards” in most pcs. Graphics cards are the more specific term, but they’re the same thing: It processes everything graphically about the pc.

Both the CPU and GPU work together. The CPU does the calculations and the GPU interprets these to show on the screen. If you click on your computer to open an app, the CPU will register that click and open the app, the GPU shows the app opening on screen. Both are essential to a computer even if you don’t have a dedicated GPU, you need some form of graphical processing(integrated graphics are in which the CPU in addition does graphical processing, although it’s terrible and you won’t see that much anymore) So as you can imagine, you need to have a good CPU and GPU for your computer to run well.

Unified Memory: basically just RAM. In most pcs the CPU and GPU have their own dedicated RAM, but unified memory allows for the CPU and GPU to share RAM. This can be useful as it lets both processors use more RAM if one runs out of space and the other isn’t using much. It also allows for faster communication between the CPU and GPU. 

NPU(Neural Engine): This is Apple’s exclusive processor (competitors just haven’t really integrated it🤷‍♂️) It’s treated as a separate processor in addition to a GPU and CPU. Basically it’s a dedicated engine that’s designed to run on-device AI models, like Apple Intelligence. This means that response times when running these AI models will be extremely fast. And since the Neural Engine is a dedicated space means that it’ll also put less strain on the CPU when doing so. I think the reason that competitors haven’t really added stuff like this is because major ai features like ChatGPT, are all off-device, so they require an internet connection and run AI models on their own servers. But with Apple Intelligence’s on-device benefits, it’s truly a game changer and I would expect major AI companies to transition to on-device.

Anyway, from what I know, that’s my take, hope that helps

The M1 Max is still a monster and are absurdly discounted, I found one for 1500 dollars, that’s insane, the only big benefit with the M4 Max is definitely battery life, the M1 Pro and M1 Max never had great battery life so M4 will be better with its 3nm architecture

And second of all, have you mentioned nano texture glass is not easy to maintain and how long will it last so on laptops? I think it will last because we are not touching it and nothing is being imprinted or stuck on the screen of laptops so we don’t need to clean it for months. But on tablets where we touch to scroll and touch to draw via Apple Pencil over time, it will get smooth like it happens in case of  the matt screen guard

If it takes significant times to edit or export an 8K video, will it be better to buy three cheaper M1 laptops to run videos export or edit concurrently compared to single expensive machine to do everything (single point of failure in the event of damage, hacking or theft)? Time is money. Naturally, if you are a top YouTuber earning lots of money per month, why not buy three $10,000 Macs (max out specs) to run videos export or editing concurrently? After a few years, you can sell back your “old” Macs to Apple for gift cards or trade in to upgrade.

1. CPU cores have increased significantly, its now 16 core vs the 10 core CPU on the M1 Max (or looking at performance cores only, its 12 vs 8)
2. When you say its not just 30% faster but now is 200% faster, you actually mean 100%
3. Nanotexture is a $150 upgrade not a $100 upgrade
4. You've been able to plug in three 6K displays since the original M1 Max, despite you saying its a new feature on the M4 Max

    Not sure where he's getting 3x 6k - I guess M-series are still limited on external displays, which is unfortunate, especially considering Thunderbolt 5 can do 3 x 4k at 144Hz over a single slot.  Alternatively 2 x 6 or 8k via 1 slot.   It's gonna allow for some monster single cable docking setups..

Here is the deal.. I bought a 2016 MacBook Pro 15` in 2017. Payed 3000 dollars for it, was hoping to use it 10yrs. Now, 8 yrs later it died on me. I can use it as an external HD in Target Mode. Thats it. It had many problems in the last 4 yrs: battery, display glitch, keyboard.... I get a new MacBook every 6-8 yrs on avg. What should I buy... I edit occasionally 4k videos and need 1Tb. The difference between 16 inch 1Tb and 15" air 1Tb is huge, and I don't really like the weight of these new pro laptops. The 2016/2017 models were much thinner and lighter.

    ​​@LtW00dy While it is true that panels is optional, I think he got called out for it because that's the exact same shitty thing he regularly calls out company for, remember humane AI pin (panels maybe not be as bad functionality-wise but it's just as outrageously expensive for what it offers, and MKBHD "technically" ruined thier company) so it's fair enough to get called out if you do the exact same thing you're "technically" preaching against.

The AI pin tanked because it wasn't any good, not because he did his job and made an honest review. I'm sure as a tech reviewer, he anticipated the scrutiny that would come with making a product.

11:06 just wanted to mention, there is a App called vivid on the MacBook. The App increases the brightness of the MacBooks on even older ones. It only costs 10€ so I expect a 10$ price in America too. Basically apple only enhanced the software to support the higher brightness. In conclusion you can get the new max brightness also for the older models. Also wanted to note, that Thunderbolt 5 speeds are like 80% faster than Thunderbolt 4 speeds if I am remembering it correctly, so this is an important upgrade.

    ↳ @marcelosantos5683  👍7  2024-11-19
    @joshuaisaacallan so when he says "30% improvement" that means that the new one is 1 × 30% = 0.3 in performance?

    ↳ @matthewledford7209  👍12  2024-11-19
    @joshuaisaacallan If a value is doubled, it means that the value of the increase is equivalent the original value. The original value is always 100%. Thus, if something increases by 100%, the new value is twice as much as the original.

------------------------------------------------------------

[504] @Jianfa88Tsai  👍0  2025-01-19
This is a valid consideration, especially for a content creator who values efficiency and minimizes downtime. Here’s an analysis of your idea:

Supportive Reasoning

Distributed Workload Efficiency:
Using multiple M1 Macs allows you to distribute video export tasks across devices, effectively reducing the overall time spent on rendering and editing. If one machine fails or is compromised, the other two can continue working, eliminating the “single point of failure” risk associated with a single high-end machine.

Counter-Argument

Management Complexity:
Running multiple Macs requires extra management effort, such as synchronizing workflows, transferring files, and maintaining software and hardware updates on all devices. Additionally, the combined performance of three cheaper machines may still fall short of a single powerful machine for certain professional-grade tasks, especially with heavy multi-layer editing or 8K exports.

Action Point for Improvement

Evaluate Workflow Automation & Scalability:
Consider how well your software and workflow can scale across multiple devices. Tools like networked file systems, cloud rendering, or project synchronization (e.g., via Adobe Creative Cloud or Final Cut Pro libraries on shared storage) can make the multi-Mac setup more manageable. Additionally, assess if the bottleneck in your editing/export process is CPU, GPU, or storage. Sometimes, targeted upgrades (like external GPUs or faster storage) might make a single-machine setup viable without losing performance redundancy.

Alternative Perspective

If you are a top YouTuber with substantial revenue, investing in three high-spec Macs can further boost scalability and efficiency. The resale value of Macs is strong, so trading them in after a few years ensures you stay updated with minimal long-term cost. However, ensure your infrastructure (e.g., networking and power) can handle such setups seamlessly.

Any thoughts on the m1 MacBook Air?? Should I still buy

    ↳ @louis_sharp  👍1  2024-11-18
    Yeah. If you can get cheap it’s still a great computer. Will start showing its age in a few years, but for now it’s still excellent and competitive with non-Macs that cost a lot more. Faster than 90% of macs before it

    ↳ @isomorphic97  👍0  2024-11-18
    I wouldn’t.
My friend has one and is working more and more with intensive programs and the 8GB RAM slow her down a lot. She has to upgrade earlier than she thought.

    ↳ @louis_sharp  👍0  2024-11-18
    @isomorphic97 yeah, 8GB is really only for light use and no more than a few documents open at a time. As an Apple Specialist, it’s absolutely incredible for me that the new MacBooks start at 16GB, because it saves the awkward conversations about immediately having to spend another £200 to make the device that bit more useable and future-proofed against updates.  This makes them (especially the M2 if you don’t need the graphics performance that M3 unlocks) one of the best value propositions on the market right now, with students getting another £100 off. Another consideration for ram is the M3’s memory swap ability is incredible, but might put a bit extra strain on your SSD storage, so slightly more (512GB or more, as needed) might be beneficial if you have a more demanding work load. As with all things, it completely depends on your personal situation.

    ↳ @brightboxstudio  👍0  2024-11-18
    As usual it all depends on what you do. Mostly web browsing, email, office apps, and basic photo editing? Sure, an M1 is still great and will last a while. 

Do you do frequent raw photo editing, video editing, coding? No, you’ll hate the M1 Air. The word is that for current tasks needing more than a basic level of processing, the M2 Air is now the baseline. Get it with 16GB Unified Memory if you want it to last a while.

If you are running a graphics/video business off your Mac laptop, where you must turn around high resolution results on deadline, then the M4 Max is what you should get. Or the M4 Pro if on a budget.

    ↳ @Muhluri  👍0  2024-11-19

I might have a generational Macbook pro leap. I got 8 full years out of my 2017 intel chip MacBook Pro. IDK how its lasted this long with the pandemic and 4 plus years of college after! Finally treated myself for an upgrade, maxed out all the specs 16" M4 pro max. If I got 8 years out of an intel chip, with this new one I might not have to think about an upgrade for 10-15 years from now.

I feel weird about the nano-texture. For me one the selling points of macbooks was glossy screen over "windows" brand laptops with anti-glare because it's just so much more vibrant. You can even see it in the video, yes the reflection is reduced but you lose overall clarity.
