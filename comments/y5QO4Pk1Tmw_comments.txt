Wow.. This year you will have to upgrade from the iPhone 16 Pro Max to just the iPhone 17 Pro.. You sure are targeting a wide audience here :)

------------------------------------------------------------

[2] @hevcms  👍0  2025-09-25
i dont know whichs one to go for base or pro because the difference is 300eur (1k vs 1.3k) and i am still using my iphone 11 pro and my phone recently started slowing down and overheating crazy

------------------------------------------------------------

[3] @marcellocapone4925  👍26  2025-09-19
This will be my very first iPhone and I was dead certain on getting either the Pro or the Pro Max, until I saw the specs on the base 17 model that is. I genuinely could not believe Apple packed that much in on it. It's too good to pass up.

I don't care for the cameras much so the only point of contention was 8gb vs 12gb of ram. But I'll keep the base 17 for 3 or 4 years and by that time, phones will have 20/24gb of ram anyway, far higher than the 12gb of ram on the current Pros.

    ↳ @Jeffvs  👍0  2025-09-19
    For what do you need the 12gb ram 😂😂😂. 8 is enough

    ↳ @marcellocapone4925  👍0  2025-09-19
    @Jeffvs AI features of tomorrow are bound to be memory hungry.
I'm going for the base 17 though. In 4 years' time phones will have a lot more ram.

    ↳ @pedromartins4847  👍1  2025-09-19
    There's never enough ram!

Made the same decision since i use the same phone for over 6-7 years!

I have an iPhone XS (I have had it for 5 years now). I’m planning to buy the base sage iPhone 17. Would you guys recommend me that or to go for the pro? I’m just a regular user that uses his phone like for 5.5-6.5 hours of screen on time and listening to a lot of music.

If only the 17 had 1 Terabyte storage

    ↳ @Mm.molanam  👍5  2025-09-19
    If you are that kind of person who needs that storage, you should go for the Pro in my opinion

    ↳ @DeesBees85  👍11  2025-09-19
    Why would anyone need that much storage on their phone?

    ↳ @rusenakman  👍1  2025-09-19
    How you gonna transfer or backup?  It only support USB 2 (480 Mbps)

Going to stay with my 11Pro, we don’t get 5G LTE, and our service is poor with Verizon, (better than AT&T, T Mobile and other people that have been to my house with other carriers. My old iPhone 7 would perform just as well, with the exception of Wi-Fi, that has gotten better through the years.

Before the keynote I was going to upgrade to a 15 Pro from a 13 mini, but I will get the 17 instead, it has everything I want tbh, the 15 Pro 256 and the 17 is at the same price, plus the 17 has a new battery while the 15 Pro would be a refurbished one without a new battery so yeah, the base model is a banger this year

[46] @flutgos  👍166  2025-09-19
Going from a 13 Pro to the base 17 this year. This is easily the smallest gap between the base and Pros since the 12 series. I'd like to have the bigger screen and telephoto on the Pro Max, but it's not worth $400.

    ↳ @nmmp17  👍14  2025-09-19
    Same as me, I loved the 13Pro, and this will still feel like a pro upgrade without spending the extra 300$

    ↳ @onurdegirmencitv  👍6  2025-09-19
    the 17 and 17 Pro literally have the same exact screen. the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a larger screen though, if that's what you meant

    ↳ @Gubers  👍3  2025-09-19
    That's in part what motivated me to get the Air. The screen is larger at 6.5" vs 6.3" on the 17 and 17 PRO. But the device isn't ridiculously large and heavy like the 6.9" 17 PRO MAX. There's a few compromises for sure. But I thought about it and really don't think I'll be missing much.

    ↳ @flutgos  👍7  2025-09-19
    @jerryx2000 My battery was at 75% health, lighter, better cameras even though I'll miss a telephoto, bigger screen, 8gb of RAM vs 6. It's not an insane upgrade, but I really just wanted something new. My 13 Pro was feeling a little laggy with iOS 26 but it may have ironed itself out eventually.

    ↳ @TJZTechShow  👍1  2025-09-19
    Same here! Plus I do not like the new Pro colors…

    ↳ @False_Star  👍0  2025-09-19
    @flutgosthat’s how mine is now, but I think my battery is worse haha so the 17 is def worth the upgrade??

    ↳ @Weather_Nerd  👍1  2025-09-20
    I have watched some camera comparisons and the 2x cropped telephoto images are actually really solid, so you pretty much do have a 2x telephoto at least. Maybe not relevant since the 11 Pro but we used to consider that a tele 😅

    ↳ @njramsfan30  👍4  2025-09-20
    My wife has 13pro as well and I'm looking at everything to justify getting her the pro. But I can't find anything lol. Might go with base 17.

    ↳ @Matt_Jaramillo  👍2  2025-09-20
    We have 13 pros and just upgraded to 17 pro (white). Wasn’t fond of the color availability for the 17 pro. I currently have the graphite which is hands down my favorite color scheme. First world problems I guess lol.

    ↳ @iked4421  👍1  2025-09-20
    How often do you really need that telephoto lens? Yes it’s nice to have, but I never used mine hardly ever on my old phone, which is why I went with the base

I have been an android user since the beginning of time. My handy dandy samsung is finally seen better days. I am not only making the switch, but I do believe I'm going with the lavender 17 regular. I don't need nor want anything to fancy at the moment due to it being all new to me. My most wanted feature is the camera. I hear iphone is great for picture quality. All in all, I've watched videos, read reviews and they have steered me in this direction.  Final decision maker~ as iphone users do you believe I will be happy with this phone? (Iphone 17 regular) Hope to get some replies, as my heart and 🧠 need just a few more confirmations 😂 thanks for reading.

[53] @dadshoesx  👍0  2025-09-19
I think the main reason to go to a pro is the storage. I was seriously considering getting the Blue 17 coning from a 15 pro max, but i take a lot of photos of my kid and having the 1TB storage is a game changer for me. Here is hoping for a 1TB storage option in next years base level iphone

    ↳ @SPFboy86  👍1  2025-09-19
    Be mindful, if you have a 1 GB on device storage that might make you doing backups less often. In case the phone gets stolen, you will lose all your photos that haven't been backed up.

The reviews that I have seen that talk about cell signal reception say that the 17 pro max is the best.  All of you in urban area's don't care about this as it is not an issue with them but for those who live in rural areas need to know how well the phone can receive cellular signals. Reviewers need to focus on this aspect more. It makes me want to just skip over all of the reviews that say the same thing. Thanks for your opinion of the phones.

Boycott Apple. They bend the knee to the Trump administration and banned ICE tracking apps and ICE surveillance videos showing what they are doing. Apple is a horrible company. Never buying an Apple product again.

I know it logically makes more sense to go with the base. But I never owned a pro before. I hope the telephoto , A19 pro with an extra gpu , extra 4gb ram, 32 Mb system level cache as compared to base 12 Mb, better battery and vapor cooling chamber is more than worth the upgrade 😂

I’m in a country where there is no official apple stores, so the usual price in USD is 800 for the 17 for me it’s about 1,300 for the base 17 lol. That has kept me from changing phone since o have the IPhone 11 (lol) however I’ve finally had the change to get the new one since a family from the US, will buy it and bring it to me :D so I cannot wait to get my hands on that phone lol

I’ve upgraded from the 15 pro to the 17 base, because it saves me 17€ per month, when buying it with my internet provider.

Then some other extra discounds makig it for me

989€ for 256g sage 17, at the dutch apple store.

with my provider 
799€, for the phone 
17€ less each month for the provider equals 408€ in two years

Then, I can sell my old 15 pro for estimimate of 550€ with broken backplate and 83% battery state.

I am going to miss the design off my 15 Pro blue, but so far the 17 is doing better then I expected.

TLDR
I got the 17 base for about 250€ if I’m going te sell my 15 pro.
Also it saves me 408€ in 2 years for provider cost.

Mist Blue, my favourite iPhone 17 colour! I'll get the 17 on my birthday next year, or if earlier maybe Christmas.

This will be worth the upgrade in my opinion though!

I’d been wanting to upgrade to a bigger-screen phone for a few years, but I skipped the 16 Plus last year because of its low refresh rate. I was really holding out for the 17 Plus, but instead we got the 17 Air. I think apple scrapped  it  cause 17 Plus would have seriously cut into Pro sales

    ↳ @dwayneslens  👍2  2025-09-19
    I think that’s exactly why they did it. Very clever tbh!! Giving the Air a single camera and a bigger screen wasn’t by accident. There’s a reason to upgrade with every iPhone all the way up to the Max. If they would have given a 17 plus the features of the small 17. It would be a curtain call for all the other phones 😅

Just ordered it. Coming from the 15 pro. Better battery life, thinner, lighter, bigger screen. I wasnt too impressed with the 15 pro photo quality anyway. I went PRO before for the 120 Hz refresh, but that is now standard on non-PRO's. Good resale value on the 15 pro so the upgrade in my case only requires a small investment.

The pro has better battery life, 50% more RAM, a better performing chip, LIDAR, Adaptive Flash, 8x optical zoom, Quad mic array, better wireless connectivity, and the unibody frame feels significantly better. It all basically boils down to whether or not you like taking a lot of photos or videos. If you just casually take photos and don't really do it as a professional job or hobby then the regular 17 is pretty much the perfect iPhone.

    ↳ @scbond  👍0  2025-09-21
    Nobody needs the Pro though. The people you describe, like professional photographers, would stick to a way better dedicated camera over using a phone.

    ↳ @AMT4245  👍0  2025-09-21
    @scbondYou couldn't be more wrong. As a photography hobbiest having the ability to carry around such an advance set of cameras with me in my pocket is incredibly handy. Nobody is carrying a DSLR with them everywhere and to be real there are a lot of times I'd much rather using an iPhone. The 8x telephoto has already come in serious clutch in just the 2 days I've had this phone.

Unpopular opinion, but I really can’t stand the Dynamic Island. Watching videos on my phone feels like there’s a fly stuck on the screen. The notch was better, it sat at the edge and stayed out of the way. Dynamic Island just drags the notch further into the display and eats up more pixels. The space between the cutout and the phone’s edge? Pure wasted screen real estate.

ALL speak about making 17 feel more like a “pro” model when in fact even 250$ phones have 120hz screens and decent cameras and processors, so apple finally woke up and now everyone’s saying how wonderful the peasants got on their overpriced iPhones all the bells and whistles

I'm more of an Android phone user but but there's no denying the bass iPhone 17 is probably going to be the best Flagship ish phone this year with all the upgrades Apple did I'm even considering maybe going back to Apple for a year to experiment I used to have a iPhone all the time when we had SIM cards cuz then I could swap it back and forth

Since last 5 years I’ve been using iPhone 11 Pro + AirPods 2. I want to upgrade now. I have 2 options. iPhone 17 + AirPods Pro 3 or iPhone 17 Pro + AirPods Pro 2? 🙏🏻 iPhone 17 Pro + AirPods Pro 3 is not an option cuz AirPods Pro 3 are way more expensive than Pro 2 in my country I can’t afford both of them rn

It’s not just “pretty much Pro Display” it’s actually exactly the same display as the pros model which it never happened before in apple world. Apple is screwing themselves this year by selling more cheap phones than pro lets see if that will make up the loss revenue higher margin phones in their q2 financial

It's very little help to just refer to Apple's claims about battery life.

Pixel 10 vs iPhone 17 comparison 
(based on majority of reviews and tests)
Pixel 10 advantages:
Better battery life.
Better camera system.
More flexible and functional software UI.
Significantly better AI features and Gemini Assistant.
12gb memory vs 8gb on iPhone 17.
Better repairability and durability.

iPhone 17 advantages:
Better gaming performance.

Equally good:
Both have excellent displays.
Both have excellent everyday task performance.
Both have good haptics and sound.

I’ve been an Apple customer for years and invested in iPhone, Mac Studio, and Apple Watch Ultra. With iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, I feel frustrated by the new “liquid glass” interface. For me, it looks distracting and uncomfortable to use compared to iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.
My suggestion for Apple is to add an option in Settings > Appearance that allows users to choose between different interface styles (past designs included). This way, those who like the new look can keep it, and those who prefer the previous style can switch back.

If you have the 13 pro 14 pro and 15 pro this year the base IPhone 17 is a good reason to upgrade you get a faster chip pro motion a square camera for selfies and a decent storage upgrade for the same price as last year base IPhone so I was thinking about going pro this year but you can’t really beat the base IPhone this year

Been the person to buy the pro since 2019…. iPhone 11 Pro then upgraded to iPhone 13 Pro (2021) both bought new in full which I kept up until yesterday Jan 10th 2026. I ended up buying the base iPhone 17 512GB due to it being lighter, camera is better then the 13 pro specifically front facing camera and the 17 Pro is just much heavier. I definitely don’t regret my decision as I’ve seen numerous people with similar stories and this is the first time where the gap in terms of (tech OTHER than camera specs obviously) where the base and pro are virtually the same. I like how there’s more color options as well even tho I went with black lol. I’d say buy what fits your needs because I rarely used my camera on the pros for photos because I have an actual camera. Probably will hold onto this for another 5+ years, hope this helped someone out!

Hi, I need your honest and objective opinion. Until now I have been an Android user and have never dealt with the iOS system, but now I said it was time to change, but I am a bit skeptical and I wonder if this is for me considering that I do not know the system and if I could and how long would it take to get used to iOS? I was looking at the 17 and 17 pro and if so, which one should I choose in your opinion?

I do photography as a hobby and always convinced myself to get pro phones for the better camera features, only for me to almost never end up using the iPhone camera because I just really prefer the control a dedicated camera gives you. After talking some sense into myself in that regard, I dropped out of the Pro line (14 Pro Max) to get a regular 17 this year. The lack of ProMotion display in the base iPhone was one of the biggest things holding me back from upgrading before. I finally am free of the lightning cable!

Definitely going with the 17 Pro Max never had a max that being said I’ve always kept my phone in an OtterBox defender series with wise it’s the same size tiny bit smaller than the max lengthwise I have the 14 Pro I would definitely want the zoom .. if I’m gonna get the pro I’ll spend an extra hundred bucks and get the pro max … kind of crazy though from your review the only thing you said that was a plus from getting the max or the pro version was the Zoom camera ..
