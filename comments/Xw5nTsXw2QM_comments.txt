My dad only bought them so that he could have a headphone that can cover his full ears since he hates headphones that don’t 😂

Please never take a woman’s opinion seriously on headphones. Do yourself a favor..

[10] @jacobperez8921  👍0  2024-03-18
If they no longer charge or turn on, call customer support and send them in for replacement or repair. Everyone thinks every Usb-C works with everything, but some chargers provide too much voltage for other tech like these headphones.

    @LateBandwagon IEMs are good and debatably more comfortable, but for outdoor use, over-ear headphones can really help with the noise cancelling. (Except the larger price tag)

    I as a highschool student got the whch710n om black friday for 50% off which cost me less then $75, they have been so worth it. they're compatible with my mp3 player and they're Bluetooth. the noise canceling is a tad disappointing, but I'm telling you, invest in a nice pair of headphones, its so worth it.

I bought the XM5 for Black Friday and I’m having the same issues!! Sometimes it would charge when I plug in the charger, sometimes it wouldn’t. I’ve contacted Sony support and they said to just factory reset which would fix the issue for a while but the same problem would happen again after a couple of days. 😭

Just purchased the 720s cause they are compared to the XM5s and due to my budget they were the ones I could afford without my wallet crying 😂 Look forward to trying them out.

I imagine these pieces of crap are twice the price of a gaming headset with half the quality and uncomfortable af. Kinda like how Apple laptop is close enough to useless but cost more than a decent gaming laptop.

if u want good sound quality, go for sennheiser, audiotechnica, apple and the like, definitely not sony, bose, beats etc. as they are just bass heavy and they are geared towards people who want either a lot of bass or good anc (sony/bose)

Thank you for this video. I’ve been struggling a lot spiritually, dealing with anger issues, insecurity, jealousy and doubt. And I have a hard time believing if God truly loves me.. I know He does, but I don’t believe that all the time. Anyways, I was wondering if someone could explain HOW to surrender or “give” my problems to God. I hear that all the time, but I don’t know how to do it.

Hated the Sony XM4. I come from the perspective of a hard core AirPods Pro user and Apple Music listener. The sound quality and noise cancellation features felt cheap compared to the AirPods Max. I took my XM4s to the Apple Store the day I got them to do a comparison test with the AirPods Max, and I could not believe the difference in the music experience. I felt like I was at a private concert in the AirPods Max and felt like I was listening with $30 knock offs with the XM4. Returned it the same day and bought the AirPods Max

------------------------------------------------------------

[78] @brvhtxxbxk  👍3  2023-04-03
The xm4's are my way to go, i have em for over 6months now and dang, im always super stunned by the quality of the sound and bass, as a huge Techno and House lover, these headphones are bomb if u love a deep good bass.

Xm5 doesn't let you turn off adaptive ANC.

------------------------------------------------------------

[81] @silaee  👍148  2023-03-23
The best thing to say is that Xm5's have firmware problems i do not recommend them at all. Looking in depth, they can't last as long as their previous products because the 5's don't allow for earcup replacement. The comfort is very very miniscule for a very specific head shape and if you look at reviews for people after a couple months they say they are the most uncomfortable headphones ever because of the pressure (which is why they stay in place but it hurts). 

The noice cancellation is monitored through an AI and you can never have it fully maxed out as it assumes it itself. The AI is horrible and Sony does not care about updating it even though it's just firmware.

And worst part is the earcup shape is actually very very small and if your ears don't fit, you'll experience hell with these headphones. I don't even have big ears but my ears r different shaped from usual people and it me so much, the shallowness also was bad where your ear sits and touches the speaker which is so annoying.

Overall, try them, if they fit you keep them, but if there's even a slight discomfort don't fully go for them as it will get worse and more noticable

    ​@Misha-hv6mx i recommend going to a physical store and trying them on. I dont have the xm4's but i have the Sennheiser Momentum 4 and my wife has the XM5's. Sound quality and comfort i like my Sennheiser than the XM5 imo. If you dont care about ANC. Try other brands. Theyre cheaper and better.

    ​@KENT  do u agree on the XM 5 review that it is pretty bad after few month?

    ↳ @michielhoeijmans  👍2  2023-07-25
    I have it quite oposite comfort wise, I have big ears and the xm5 actually have bigger earcups, opposed to the xm4 my ears fit in the xm5, also after wearing the 4's the plastic behind the earcup pads pushes trough the pad which is uncomfortable. Honestly try them both in the store since it comes down to personal preference and comfort

Good review until the sound part. These are pretty garbage in sound. XM3-5 actually.
Basically anything will beat them. Koss Porta Pros are 30$ and sound better. If you want to compare sound to something that is worth as much try the famous HD600. Compared to the XM4 or XM5 they are so far better that these sound like one of those cheap headsets that you get in a set with mouse and keyboard.
There are wireless, ANC headphones that are much better than these too, but unless you are constantly near a construction, just get any good closed back headphones instead of these.
They are actually the single most hated headphones amongst headphone people.

Y'all skullcandy have a RANGE of amazing options. I'm pretty sure mine are the hesh evos, they're normally £90 but I got them for £60 after a student discount.

    ↳ @mazerunner3626  👍2  2023-11-24
    both is not worth if for a college student! get soundcore q30s (50-70 euros depending if its on sale) instead. sonys does have a slightly better noice cancelling and sound quality, but it still doesnt justify the price tag :) dont buy into the hype guys. sonys shouldnt be priced that much.

would only say its somewhat worth it wth a price tag : 100-150.

    @mazerunner3626 you suggested soundcore while we were talking about sony. It's obvious to a mildly intelligent person which ones I'm talking about. Anyhow, a person with less financial resources will find that the xm4 is unnecessary and expensive. It makes sense, because he has to cope one way or another, like someone who thinks luxury cars are necessary and expensive cause the purpose of a car is to move from A to B, yet a luxury car will be first on the list when he can afford it 🤡

This is why I buy all of my electronics through Best buy. And I belong to the super tech or whatever it is club. Yes it's expensive. But I kid you not. If anything breaks down. And it's within my extended warranty. I've had things replaced 7/8 times. The whole PlayStation to dibolical ... We had problems with our router. Of course my son led me towards the best. Just completely quit on us. They replace it no questions asked. I was devastated whenever I found out my son's headphones were not purchased on my account. $400 down the drain. Please get that super tech deal. I kid you not It has saved me so much money. And the boys learn to hard lesson. Have to use my account very important.

maybe the thing where you put the charger broke they r cheap to repair but it could also be a battery problem like over heat or spilling something , if you spilled water on them just let them dry but if its juice then you need to repair them if they just stopped working then should take a toothpick and see if the thing in the middle of the charging hole is dangling if yes then its broken if not its a battery problem if it expanded you need to change it because it could also explode

Many people threw shade at xm5 in the comments but I’m having a pleasant experience with them. I’ve had these headphones for half a year now. I have glasses and small ears without piercings. I find them extremely comfortable (It’s so comfy that sometimes I get sleepy when I put them on while studying.). They don’t fall of my head usually but I found that tying/clippinng your hair back is a good solution. When not listening to anything, the noise cancelling is not perfect but if you start listening something, you won’t hear a thing. I have two cons, though. Firstly there is a setting that can turn off voice cancelling when you start speaking. However it lags a bit and if you have this on, you won’t be able to mumble or sing the song; which annoys me personnally. And the second thing which was also mentioned in the video is that is takes up a lot space in the bag so I can’t carry them around easily. I’ve never had xm4 before so I can’t compare them but I think you would also be satisfied with them for paying a lower price.

I like the JBLive. Great sound got them on a black Friday sale for half off. And paid 60$. I’ve had them for two years and they work great still 

Sony used to be amazing but i bought a speaker from them and it’s terrible sound. And the earbuds broke so fast. 

My sister uses the JBL brand and ever since it’s all i use.

When it comes to expensive rechargeable headphones, get the extended warranty and buy them from best buy so you deal with an actual person.  Save the receipt. If you don't want to deal with breaking such, get a wired with detachable cord, not a usb...If you need it to attach to a usb, get a dongle.

Honestly I bought them and they’re complete garbage. Sure they’re an amazing upgrade from $100 headphones 5 years ago, but I compared them to the Bose in ear QC first generation I’ve had for years and although they do have slightly better noise cancellation.. the sound volume and everything about the in ear older head headphones just seemed better. Between the two I’m keeping the older Bose because is not really an upgrade it’s just newer

I have the xm4s after splashing some cash after my beats kept breaking! I LOVE THEM!! They don’t fall off my head and they’re great for travel!

    not sure if youll see this but would you say they are better than beats? i have previosuly had a pair of 7 year old brats studio 3s and love them to death, but the arms have snapped and arent comfortable to wear anymore. i got given the xm4s as a gift recently, but havnt opened them as i am considering exchanging the for a new pair of studio 3s as i can get them where i live.

    ↳ @abiwalk7726  👍1  2025-10-11
    @zoegisellehiya, I think it’s mostly down to preference but I still have my Sony headphones and they haven’t had a single issue with them. They still hold battery very well. I don’t keep them in the case (not a good idea) and they haven’t broken still. My beats were treated the same and they broke on so many occasions for me. My friend got some as a gift a year ago and she also absolutely loves them. The app is also really good and you can chose from multiple different settings/ noise cancelling modes.
I hope this helps! If you have any other questions let me know 🎉

Just bought these xm4 and my heads too small or the headphones are too big. I wish they were tighter on my head. They’re super lose and fall off. For $300 they’re terrible. Besides the actual technology, they feel CHEAP. just bought them and my charging port already feels hard like it gets stuck in there. The ear foam part seems fragile and like it will crack and peel with normal wear faster than expected. For $300 I expected way more. I’m sad but I think I’m returning

I've been using the XM3 since 2018 and decided to upgrade to the XM5. For some reason, the XM5 keeps on stuttering or gets distorted audio while in use. It sometimes even shuts down randomly. Apparently, many people experience one or all of these problems with their XM5. There are also many cases online of XM5s breaking at the hinge. After having it randomly shut down for the 5th time since I got it 4 days ago, I just returned the XM5 and will be buying the XM4 instead.

------------------------------------------------------------

[234] @moonBright_halcyonDays  👍4  2023-03-31
I have the XM4s, but not the XM5. i can definitely second the comfort aspect. I have a stud in one ear and I wear a fishhook in the other, and while I do have to adjust the fishhook when I first put the cup on that ear I don't ever have to readjust, and the ear with the stud is fine without any adjustment at all. I also have no problems wearing them for hours at a time over my glasses.

I do agree, however, that they're not the most secure thing to wear on your head. If I've got both cups on my ears it takes some rather vigorous shaking to dislodge them and I can tip my head all the way forward and all the way back without issue, but I wear them with only one cup on a lot when I'm at home, to ensure that if someone's trying to get my attention they can, and in that state I can't tip my head particularly far back without them falling off, though I can still tip my head forward fine, and it only takes moderate shaking of my head to dislodge them that way.

[242] @Bully_Biscuit  👍7  2023-12-23
As someone who has had two pairs of the XM4 and one pair of the XM5 do NOT waste your money on these. The xm4’s have a terrible feedback issue that causes loud pitched noise, had this problem with both xm4’s and the second pair had this problem after a few months. Not to mention how the xm4’s also break easily. My first pair broke after not even a full year and the piece holding the headband to the ear cup is so tiny and thin that it’s inevitable for it to break. The xm5’s are too expensive for headphones with adjusting band to not hold its place. That’s right when you adjust the band to the size of your head over the course of you using them within those minutes you will have to keep adjusting it as it slides out of place. The noise cancellation on the xm5’s fluctuates all the time, if you have a fan on you will hear and feel the pressure change and it happens extremely often and for those with sensory issues when it comes to sounds (like myself) it will drive you crazy. 
Don’t get me wrong the noise canceling is great but I suggest going with a different brand of noise canceling headphones as I would like to not have hearing loss from the high pitched noise. Plus these issues shouldn’t be there for a billion dollar companies products. So many others have also experienced these issues.

Should I buy these or the xm4 model? They both cost the same here and I want an overall good headphone for music/studying/gaming/general use.

I also want something that is more durable, something that lasts longer. I also don't really travel much. But I do really like ANC/Transparency.

[255] @mrcoffee315  👍0  2024-08-11
Sony overpriced for what you actually get. Got an xm5 and decided to return them. If I pay $400 for a headphone I expect to at least have a max audio that would break my eardrums.

Imo as someone that owns the xm4s id say the xm3s are probably the best value as they have the better more neutral sound and will quite often go on sale as theyre an older model, they support aptx and aptxhd which the newer ones dont. The xm4 however has some more quality of life features such as the sensor on the left earcup and the auto turn off if not used feature. The xm5s however are NOT worth it at all. Even at 300 I still wouldnt consider the xm5s.

    Damn
So many people had issues with these headphones and they cost heaps in my country

I’m getting mine today as a birthday gift
What’s your eq seeing settings ?

Also some people say when they talk the music cuts off do you know how I can turn that off?? In the app?

    ↳ @Ohkeh640  👍0  2023-06-08
    Update: I hardly use them. Only sometimes when working out at home. They don’t get loud enough and the eq settings suck! Also get too hot around the ears and I have a small head they aren’t tight enough on the sides. For the price they’re suck crap quality and crappy sound not loud enough that’s for sure. I stick to my old wireless Powerbeats pro over the ear hook earphones. Even tho the little b logo sticker came off when washing them. They work fine and are water proof and easy to use. Just itch my ear from the silicone rubber but I wash my ears with soap at night and it’s fine etc. ugh the Sony ones I hardly pull out tbh but yeah 
Also the case is uncomfy and ugly and the zip broke on mine so I can’t zip it closed. They’re a rip off in my opinion. Lol

[268] @lindsaydance_05  👍0  2023-04-06
Why get those when you could get ones you can use with a cable or Bluetooth, don't laptops and computers tend to have Bluetooth problems.
Ps; I use the HyperX Could Mix headphones because they're Bluetooth and wired capable and I'm pretty sure they're less expensive then either of these and likely an ok alternative if you don't need to fold them up because my HyperX headphones have always lasted and if I replace them it's because I just want a new pair of headphones. I mean songs are really loud at a bit less than half volume and everything has been clear even at the lowest volume.

Best part about Sony headphones isn't about the headphones, it's about their smartphones. Their smartphones still have headphone jacks! In 2024! So you can use some of the best vintage headphones, the ones they use in studios, in your smartphone. Okay, sorry for geeking out..

No wonder everyone buys these they are brookie headphones😂 If your bluetooth headphones don't cost at least $1000 don't talk to me

....The XM5 just look so cheap and are upon examination very cheaply built . 
    ....Sony abandoned the unrivaled fit of the XM3 XM4 Which is better than any headphones in my collection . 
    ....I feel like a peasant wearing the XM5s And Sony Felt It A Good Thing To Up The Price By $50.00 . 
    ....I Returned 2 Pairs Of XM5s Months Apart Trying To See The Value In Them And Other Than The ANC Their Is No Value I Could Find In The XM5s . 
    ....My SoundCore Q35 & Q45 Have Better Sound Quality And Look Much Nicer Especially The Q45 .

I wore mine to the gym everyday, cleaned the outside, could never clean the inside mesh. I can back after leaving the state for a couple months and found mold growing on them…. I don’t understand how I would clean it without damaging them. Sony Xm4 btw

    They sell you an actual piece of ewaste! Awesome!

I would jokingly call these ewaste because they’re worthless trash in terms of sound quality, but I guess quality control is also bad because they probably make them for $5/pair lol.

I've had the same thing happen to me, but I had a different brand of headphones. They just stopped charging for some reason, so I got a new pair, but they weren't that great. Turns out they actually used the same charger type, so I used the new charger for my old headphones, and it worked.
I'm not sure if this will work in your case, but just sharing my expereince with the problem, good luck!

    @hanscapon222I bought the Sony 720 a couple of days ago and it’s such a hugeeee upgrade from the on ear JBL. No longer does my ear hurt because I have glasses. But the strongest noise cancelling makes me have a headache and migraine 😢
Looks like I’m sensitive to the noise cancelling whatever they do to your ears. I put the noise cancelling setting to around half way and I withstand it more easily but it does tire my brain out. But even without turning the noise cancelling on, the over ear design of the 720 is so good.

    ↳ @naylisyazwina6836  👍0  2024-04-14
    @Batman_097Sony 720 is amazing. Just got it a couple of days ago. I wear glasses and hijab and they are super comfortable. Zero discomfort even for long hours. The noise cancelling is super good if your ears and brain can handle it. Some people cannot handle it because more sensitive ear drums or something.
