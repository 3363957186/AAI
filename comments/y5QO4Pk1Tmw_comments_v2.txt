Original: Wow.. This year you will have to upgrade from the iPhone 16 Pro Max to just the iPhone 17 Pro.. You sure are targeting a wide audience here :)

Original: i dont know whichs one to go for base or pro because the difference is 300eur (1k vs 1.3k) and i am still using my iphone 11 pro and my phone recently started slowing down and overheating crazy

Original: This will be my very first iPhone and I was dead certain on getting either the Pro or the Pro Max, until I saw the specs on the base 17 model that is. I genuinely could not believe Apple packed that much in on it. It's too good to pass up.

I don't care for the cameras much so the only point of contention was 8gb vs 12gb of ram. But I'll keep the base 17 for 3 or 4 years and by that time, phones will have 20/24gb of ram anyway, far higher than the 12gb of ram on the current Pros.
Sentiment: positive (confidence 0.92)

I'm going for the base 17 though. In 4 years' time phones will have a lot more ram.

Original: Going from a 13 Pro to the base 17 this year. This is easily the smallest gap between the base and Pros since the 12 series. I'd like to have the bigger screen and telephoto on the Pro Max, but it's not worth $400.

    Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.77)

    ↳ ✅ @Gubers  👍3  2025-09-19
    Original: That's in part what motivated me to get the Air. The screen is larger at 6.5" vs 6.3" on the 17 and 17 PRO. But the device isn't ridiculously large and heavy like the 6.9" 17 PRO MAX. There's a few compromises for sure. But I thought about it and really don't think I'll be missing much.

    Original: @jerryx2000 My battery was at 75% health, lighter, better cameras even though I'll miss a telephoto, bigger screen, 8gb of RAM vs 6. It's not an insane upgrade, but I really just wanted something new. My 13 Pro was feeling a little laggy with iOS 26 but it may have ironed itself out eventually.

    ↳ ✅ @Weather_Nerd  👍1  2025-09-20

Original: I have been an android user since the beginning of time. My handy dandy samsung is finally seen better days. I am not only making the switch, but I do believe I'm going with the lavender 17 regular. I don't need nor want anything to fancy at the moment due to it being all new to me. My most wanted feature is the camera. I hear iphone is great for picture quality. All in all, I've watched videos, read reviews and they have steered me in this direction.  Final decision maker~ as iphone users do you believe I will be happy with this phone? (Iphone 17 regular) Hope to get some replies, as my heart and 🧠 need just a few more confirmations 😂 thanks for reading.

Original: I’ve upgraded from the 15 pro to the 17 base, because it saves me 17€ per month, when buying it with my internet provider.

Then some other extra discounds makig it for me

989€ for 256g sage 17, at the dutch apple store.

with my provider 
799€, for the phone 
17€ less each month for the provider equals 408€ in two years

Then, I can sell my old 15 pro for estimimate of 550€ with broken backplate and 83% battery state.

I am going to miss the design off my 15 Pro blue, but so far the 17 is doing better then I expected.

TLDR
I got the 17 base for about 250€ if I’m going te sell my 15 pro.
Also it saves me 408€ in 2 years for provider cost.

The notch was better, it sat at the edge and stayed out of the way. Dynamic Island just drags the notch further into the display and eats up more pixels. The space between the cutout and the phone’s edge? Pure wasted screen real estate.

My suggestion for Apple is to add an option in Settings > Appearance that allows users to choose between different interface styles (past designs included). This way, those who like the new look can keep it, and those who prefer the previous style can switch back.

Original: Been the person to buy the pro since 2019…. iPhone 11 Pro then upgraded to iPhone 13 Pro (2021) both bought new in full which I kept up until yesterday Jan 10th 2026. I ended up buying the base iPhone 17 512GB due to it being lighter, camera is better then the 13 pro specifically front facing camera and the 17 Pro is just much heavier. I definitely don’t regret my decision as I’ve seen numerous people with similar stories and this is the first time where the gap in terms of (tech OTHER than camera specs obviously) where the base and pro are virtually the same. I like how there’s more color options as well even tho I went with black lol. I’d say buy what fits your needs because I rarely used my camera on the pros for photos because I have an actual camera. Probably will hold onto this for another 5+ years, hope this helped someone out!

Original: I do photography as a hobby and always convinced myself to get pro phones for the better camera features, only for me to almost never end up using the iPhone camera because I just really prefer the control a dedicated camera gives you. After talking some sense into myself in that regard, I dropped out of the Pro line (14 Pro Max) to get a regular 17 this year. The lack of ProMotion display in the base iPhone was one of the biggest things holding me back from upgrading before. I finally am free of the lightning cable!

Original: Definitely going with the 17 Pro Max never had a max that being said I’ve always kept my phone in an OtterBox defender series with wise it’s the same size tiny bit smaller than the max lengthwise I have the 14 Pro I would definitely want the zoom .. if I’m gonna get the pro I’ll spend an extra hundred bucks and get the pro max … kind of crazy though from your review the only thing you said that was a plus from getting the max or the pro version was the Zoom camera .. 
Of course I always say to myself. I’ll wait till the 18th team comes out.  Then reality sets in I could be dead by then.😂

Original: Base 17 makes sense for me, going from a 12.  Actually the 12 handles most tasks just fine, but I am having an issue with an AI app crashing, so I need an upgrade. Cost is an issue. If 17 does it then that is what I will get.

    Original: I also got the 17 in that color. My biggest gripe compared to the 16 is that the speakers sound a little bit quieter than last year, but they give fuller sound. I hope this is a software issue, and can be fixed.

Original: Great phones this year, all around: iPhone 17 and Pro series and Air, too. I’m with you about regular models having wide angle and telephoto instead of the ultrawide. I rarely use ultra wide and care so much more for the telephoto lens on the Pros!
