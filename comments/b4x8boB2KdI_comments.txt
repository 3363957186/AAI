They should add the nano texture to the iphones, it's actually the device used most outside. My s24 ultra, is a bliss when looked in the sunlight...

How to get Apple to add MacOS to the iPad. It's a shame that Apple's greed is so much more important than the needs of its customers.

------------------------------------------------------------

[7] @IReapZz95  👍0  2024-11-08
Love you man, but your reasoning for why the nano textured screen is worth if for the mac vs the ipad makes absolutely no sense. With both devices you are using them up close

HI dave what is the best price point for previous generations? I am looking into getting a MacBook after all these years.

I’m worried the M4 MBP base won’t be able to handle my Gmail while watching P-Hub at the same time. Can anyone confirm it works or do I need the Pro model instead?

------------------------------------------------------------

[10] @nishilvy  👍0  2024-12-01
Good review as always. But expected you to use 16 if going for m4 max due to cooling compatibility.

------------------------------------------------------------

[11] @covfefe69  👍0  2024-11-08
The form factor looks bigger than the 2015 i've been loving for 9 years. I'm ready to upgrade, maybe I need to wait for an M4 air, though I wish I learned more about the actual architecture of the machine.

I still have my M1 Max macbook pro 16”, it’s still a beast and i don’t have any particular reason to upgrade. I run my architectural stuff amazing, still sounds amazing, still have a massive battery life. It’s awesome  .

    I'm still on a m1 air and not a complaint in the world. I'd argue that the first gen m series chips are still very competitive in today's market when compared to windows laptops especially at the price you can get them at now.

    I just got the M4 max, upgrading from M1 MBA. Hopefully I am not going to think of something else till M10 or something.

    ↳ @BremeMETRO  👍26  2024-11-07
    do NOT buy a screen protector, it will press your screen against your keyboard and has risks of cracking the display, do not listen to these people, if you want one buy a magnetic one that only gets put on when its open

    ↳ @HydroSheep  👍1  2024-11-07
    @BremeMETROyou can get a thin plastic film one (i have an anti-reflect) and it works but the thick glass ones are a no-no

    Same, my 16" m2 pro is still plenty powerful for anything I throw at final cut pro. Kinda dig the new screen tho ngl

    ↳ @sigma_z  👍0  2024-11-08
    @Murv  screen protectors for laptops aren't really that insane, it protects your screen against scratches and marks of the keyboard when closed.

My 1 week new MBP 16 had the scratches and marks left from the keyboard when the MBP was closed in clampshell from being inside my bag.

I can only assume that when in my bag, there was just enough pressure on the lid to make the screen touch the keyboard and when walking or cycling around caused the scratches.

Luckily I have Apple Care.  So that was taken care of.  But now, I have a thin plastic screen protector always and I've seen the matte one also which will do the same as apples new anti reflection coating.

    ↳ @BremeMETRO  👍1  2024-11-08
    @ and a stupid one? who would wanna upgrade when their old mac does everything they do?

    ↳ @RWK_ridewithkev  👍0  2024-11-08
    Def dont do that​@sigma_z

    ↳ @Mufire1991  👍0  2024-11-09
    Same. On my 14" M1 Pro since release and it's still an absolute beast. This was my first Mac after 28 years of Windows, and I've never been more pleased. I have a new high end gaming laptop that cost about 2 times the Macbook and it's not even close to the Mac in quality and performance, while being hella noisy and a big heater. A shame Macs still can't properly run games.

    youre coping, the m4 is in a different league

    ↳ @TheTradingParrot  👍0  2024-11-13

    ↳ @adityach7  👍0  2024-11-22
    @CNDcovert Yeah, it was the base M1, and this one is M4 max, so I think I should be fine for 6

    If you'd like a glossy display on your matte screen, you can always use a glossy screen protector to achieve the effect.

    ↳ @batmanonholiday4477  👍0  2024-11-07
    @redwanabir2557 can you get some some sort third party matte coating/film after you bought the glossy screen or is there no way to tone down the reflections on macs other than ordering the nano-textures?

    ↳ @PKperformanceEU  👍2  2024-11-07
    Does the displayed image take any sort of degradation over the glossy version? I mean sharpness, contrast, black levels etc?

    @Personal-Opinion-x it's not an issue on a laptop at all.

    ↳ @DrewCurry-n6c  👍1  2024-11-07
    does the nano-texture affect the resolution, like a downgrade?

    ↳ @NITEAMJordon  👍0  2024-11-07
    @ss223wy there is no way you need an m4 for law school. Get an older model if you can't afford the new ones

    ↳ @michaemia  👍0  2024-11-08
    No internals? Two fans or One fans? This review feels kind of rushed.

    ↳ @GuyGamer1  👍3  2024-11-08
    @PKperformanceEU With the nano-texture you sacrifice contrast. Blacks look a little more grey, and sharpness is lost.

There are comparison videos already and you can see the difference. It's not massive, but it's similar to most matte displays. Enough that I would say don't get nano-texture unless you primarily work outdoors or under bright lighting.

Lots of comparisons available on the iPad and Studio Display which already have this.

    ↳ @KDTechverse  👍0  2024-11-11
    It's ok it's understandable that you were in a hurry 😅

    @GuyGamer1One thing to note is that the MacBook Pros use quantum dots so  there shouldn’t be as big of a difference in quality compared to iPads and stuff

[36] @ghunterforever  👍73  2024-11-08
as someone who is old enough to remember things: laptop screen use to be all matt finish. apple started doing glossy screen back in late 2008, and that was considered "trendy" because apple, and the appeared higher contrast, and now they are just going back to pre 2008 and ask you to pay a premium.

    ↳ @CyberTweaker  👍12  2024-11-09

------------------------------------------------------------

[42] @abdullahmirza7606  👍0  2024-11-08
I installed a $4 matte screen protector on my M3 Pro Macbook Pro and it absolutely looks the same as that nano textured screen on the M4. $150 for the nano-finish is kinda too much, $50 or so would have been understandable.

    @_Fl4K I grew up on windows and not once did I upgrade my ram or ssd. Upgrading your computer is the way to go for most people who need RAM and if you need storage, consider an external drive. It’s more economical anyway

    ↳ @_Fl4K  👍4  2024-11-07

    @_Fl4K oh, repairability is a whole different issue. I think it’s hit or miss depending on the brand. Apple, Razer, and many others are notorious for being difficult to repair. Luckily, I’ve found my Apple devices to be very reliable. Hopefully they continue to hold up in the future!

    Same here never liked them and despise the OS. I'm still using my 2016 Dell XPS 13 9350 with an I7-6560U chip. 
I'm a software engineer and use this for just my fun projects but it still works for my everyday daily of movies, coding, etc.

With its 4K touchscreen, 1 TB SDD (only used like 150gb🤣)and 12Gb of ram only thing that sucks is the battery life now but for 8 years of extremely heavy usage it still perfect and no issues.

But seeing all these huge performance boosts I might hop on the M4 MacBook pro, just still have to get use to that OS I use a M1 MacBook pro for work and love everything except the os maybe just too use to windows OS is all.

The crazy part of how good apple silicon is, if you go back to the original M1 that was already shockingly fast and efficient, they priobaby already had the 1,2,3,4 roadmap planned out and knew exaclty how fast they were going to improve, and you wonder if they could have even jumped straight in at what an m4 does, but sand bagged it to eek out maximum profits, you know their Improvement is so linear, it's got to be controlled.

It is worth noting that the M4 Max has 546 GB/s bandwidth only in the top version. The binned one has something around 406 GB/s.

    I can’t say I would ever notice or care but thanks for the info.

    ↳ @nullptr_yt  👍8  2024-11-07
    This is also to be expected, full set of memory controllers on binned dies are either faulty or shut down due to the rest being broken. If you opt in for a lesser chip, you can't get as much system memory either. 406 GB/s is also a step up from the M3 step down to 300 GB/s. M2 Max had 400 GB/s.

    ↳ @PeterRince  👍9  2024-11-07
    @nullptr_yt True, but this info is veeery rarely given in any M4 materials. Check the charts that Dave used - it is all the same stuff, as everywhere else - M4 Max = 546 GB/s. This year it is even more tricky, because the memory options are locked and switching the RAM options causes in many cases also a change of the CPU type.

    All chips are binned, it's just a matter of which "bin".  I know I'm being a vocab nazi, but it's been a peev of mine ever since Apple people discovered the word.

    ↳ @GreatTaiwan  👍0  2024-11-10

    ↳ @kpsayyed84  👍0  2024-11-11
    Define binned please😊

    ↳ @SeniorKlean  👍0  2024-11-12
    ​@kpsayyed84  "Binning" refers to metaphorical (or maybe literal) bins, as in containers, used to sort the chips by performance capability.

All processor dies get tested for the top spec, those that pass go in the top bin.
Those that fail get tested for the next spec down, those that pass go into that bin.
This may repeat several times.  Apple only does it twice.  Intel does it like 7 times.
The percentage of dies that pass the top spec is referred to as "yield".  One reason Apple Silicon tends to be expensive is that they use advanced manufacturing nodes much earlier in their development than competitors when they still have very low yield.

The actual process involves using lasers and acid baths to disable certain parts of the processor die when it fails certain tests.  Then when the die gets bonded to the chip package some auxiliary components will get connected in different patterns to set it's speed and tell the rest of the system which model it is.

Hi new subscriber here! Thanks for this review! I am between an 14 inch M4 pro chip with 14/20, 48 ram 2 tb..
OR an M4 MAX chip with 14/32, 36 ram and 2 tb for video editing. I recently bought and returned the M3 max on a 14 inch because it was starting to get hot already… I’m wondering if the M4 chips have the same heating issues and if getting an M4 pro chip with more ram or a MAX chip with extra memory bandwidth & GPU is better when it comes to editing? Thank you!! ☺️🙏🏼

[183] @jothamdaledejesus2708  👍0  2024-11-13
I just bought a new m4 mac book pro with the nano texture display. The main reason why I bought the laptop is because my current Microsoft surface 4 laptop is dying. In the middle of class it just randomly black screened and wouldn't turn on till after class had finished. So it's a massive upgrade. Also got the nano texture display because I tend to study while commuting to uni, and I've gotten used to the non-glossy look on my desktop set up at home and much prefer the fact that it doesn't reflect anything and diffuses any sort of light hitting the screen  as it causes me to strain less whilst studying or writing up essays. Tbh, I almost bought a MacBook M3 Pro this year and am glad I waited for the m4 to come out at it's practically the perfect laptop for me in terms of battery life, price to performance (even with my student discount it's expensive, but for me it's a worth while investment for the rest of my uni degree), some photo editing, and so forth. Mind you, I only got the base model M4 as it's all I need. I'm not coding, or running intensive programs on a regular basis. Just need top read cases, write up case notes, class notes, essays, the odd bit of photo editing, etc.

mac gang, I'm a PC guy, software dev, stopped gaming a year ago, I want a machine for coding/running vm's/running local db servers/software development/music production/video editing, in that order.  Was going to (naturally) build myself a Zen 5 rig (AMD 9900X) or an Arrow Lake rig (Intel 265K, yes, I know the review are out and they're questionable, it's still a beast).  Wanted to know how the performance of the M4 Pro compares to the AMD and Intel offerings I mentioned, it's hard to get a direct comparison, wanted to know if it would be worth making the switch and learning a whole new platform (I learn fast, I've been in tech my whole life).  I like how Apple has a trade-up program, so the initial high cost of entry is justified by the very reasonable cost of upgrading every 3 years.  Build will have 64GB ram and 1TB storage.

    If you're paying attention to the screen and have somewhat sharp eyes, you will notice it. The difference isn't bad by any means, but you can tell and can't unsee it once you do. If you're a graphics designer, I would go with glossy given what I've said.

Hey all, I'm in the market to upgrade from my early 2015 13 inch macbook pro i5 8g RAM, 256 storage. I tend to take care of my computer and really don't like change/re-upgrading frequently that much lol (still works fine, just speakers are blown and getting a bit slow, limited storage left etc). I don't really do any video or photo editing nor gaming; most of my work involves basic laptop stuff (email, youtube, surfing websites, netflix, video conferences), medical stuff (electronic medical records/patient charts) which does involve using secure browsing software etc, research papers/citation mangers (often includes lots of tabs open and split screen needs). I currently tend to bring my laptop to work/travel with me a lot but haven't noticed the weight of my old macbook pro at all (I'm also a larger individual). While at home I usually use an external mouse and one single external monitor. I think I am between Macbook pro 14in M4 (16 ram, 512 SSD) and the 15 in M3 Air with 16 ram/512 SSD (but also open to other suggestions/comparisons). Obviously I would like the best deal out there but money/saving a few bucks is not my top priority. I keep hearing that I likely don't need the pro and the air would suffice but I also can't ignore the seemingly minimal price point difference, better display/speakers and more ports of the macbook pro. Any insight? Thx much!

    ↳ @ViralEnter10ment  👍1  2024-11-07
    @thescentsofme  idk what that is, im using vivobook pro 14 Oled 3K 90Hz 10bit for almost 2.5 yrs and never had a bit of a problem. Even though charts on screen all the time. Either apple using cheap displays or their dual OLED tech fckd up

    ↳ @Metamine0  👍2  2024-11-07
    @ViralEnter10ment nah, pwm is just an issue due to the nature of OLEDs. Iirc, everyone technically sees it, but about 5-10% of the population is actually extra sensitive to it to the point that that they're unable to use OLEDs that have too low of a PWM DC dimming rate. You need that rate to be much higher than the 480 Hz Apple currently is using (the screen is still 120 Hz, but the rate at which the pixels themselves are refreshing is much higher to try to mitigate PWM flicker).

    @ViralEnter10ment yeah it's unfortunate for those who are sensitive to it, especially because OLED is quickly becoming the main screen tech on so many higher end laptops. Leaves out my IPS and Mini LED buddies. I myself can feel a higher strain with OLED but nothing nearly as bad as those that suffer from headaches, nausea, etc.

    ↳ @jonathaningram8157  👍0  2024-11-07
    @Metamine0ive had a lot more flickering issue with lcd than with oled (i own an LG cx, pg32ucdm and a iPhone 16 pro). And I'm usually very sensitive to flicker. My iPhone se had flicker issue as well as my previous lcd monitor and many Asian emulator console like the retroid pocket 2s. Oled has been almost perfect for me. The only big issue is the gamma tied to the refresh rate. 
Anyway it sucks for those sensitive to that.

    ↳ @Metamine0  👍0  2024-11-07
    @  well the flicker on OLED from my understanding is different compared to your standard display flicker. It's almost imperceptible because of how fast the pixels in PWM flickering happens but for a subset of folks, they can still sense the flickering even if they can't really see it too well, causing headaches nausea etc like you seem to be able to for LCD. It also could be that the OLED panels you view are ones with generally higher brightness or very good DC dimming, but I do find it fascinating that you seem to be sensitive to it on LCDs. Have you viewed a lot of different LCDs or Mini LEDs and noticed any difference between it's effect on you?

    ↳ @jonathaningram8157  👍0  2024-11-08
    @Metamine0 So far I've tried only one mini led on the macbook and no issue at all. I mainly had issue with IPS display but it really depends, like for the same device one can have the issue and the other doesn't. Everytime I show the issue to someone else they just can't see it. It doesn't necessarily give me headache, some do but other are just bothering to look at.

    ↳ @Metamine0  👍0  2024-11-08
    @ yeah, there's a lot of variability with displays since you never really know if you're getting a great top of the line panel or your standard bargain bin stuff. Especially with LCDs since they're so common

5:46 Space Gray was removed last year on the Macbook Pros with M3 series. So, this year is the continuation of same trend.

------------------------------------------------------------

[229] @43fghpu9h  👍1  2024-11-08
00:30 Dave, consider giving the M4 a special outline or a more noticable color value, so that it's easier to glance which chips are the new ones and which are the old ones, in the performance benchmark. Also consider ordering it so that the chips are listed in order of release, or something. It's confusing that the M4's are in the middle.

Nice short review. Two things. 1 the nano texture is a pain to clean without the supplied cloth. 2 is the Max chip in the 14" body still being thermal throtlled and making the fans get annoyingly loud? I am hoping the binned max isnt but waiting for reviews.

    ↳ @kageofkonoha  👍1  2024-11-07
    @user-jr7bb6g9ev M3 max in the 14" chassis most defiantly throttled. I have hands on with Eight 14" M3 max laptops.

    ↳ @kageofkonoha  👍1  2024-11-07
    @user-jr7bb6g9ev The M3 Max in the 14" chassis most defiantly throttled under load once cooling system was heat soaked. I tested eight 14 m3 max macbook pros at work.

    ↳ @Div033  👍1  2024-11-07
    @user-jr7bb6g9ev M3 Max absolutely throttled, especially in heavy 3d workloads. At least in the 14".

    ↳ @Div033  👍2  2024-11-08
    @user-jr7bb6g9ev Source is me - I had one. Returned it for an M3 Pro after I observed the fan curve and throttling behavior when working in UE5. Fan noise and performance starts out good, but once it hits 100C it starts to throttle, performance drops by ~50% (Edit: I can't remember exactly... might've been more like 20-30% drop - 50% might've been the diff between pro and max), and the fans spin up mad. Once it gets down to 70-80C the fan speed drops, it restores performance, and starts to heat up again. It continues like this cyclically.

    ↳ @Div033  👍1  2024-11-08
    @user-jr7bb6g9ev I think that behavior really is just limited to consistently beefy GPU workloads like that. If you’re not taxing the GPU constantly then I think it’s not as big of a deal…. Even like during renders or while compiling. Those actions have a clear start and endpoint, so it’s not so bad to just deal with it for some time. When you’re in an app for potentially multiple hours and you’re experiencing the behavior I described, though, it gets annoying quickly.

    ↳ @CyberTweaker  👍1  2024-11-09
    Rumors says it does not thermal throttles because apple pump less watt into it by default. And notice the psu wattage is way lower than the 16 inch m4 max. So basically you pay for single core or multit core short burts. Imho you only get the m4 max if you go 16inch

I got mine about a week ago, and couldn't be happier with this computer. It is fast as can be, I can play my games at the maximum graphics settings, which I have never been able to do on any Mac, and it holds battery very long.. . like I fell asleep with it while I was using Logic Pro - something that typically sucked down a lot of battery on my older laptop. Was shocked to wake up and find it was not only not dead yet, but had around 85% of its charge. Haven't been as gung ho about computer before, but I really love this one.

Thanks in advance!

    If you need an apple to fit in with all the other cool kids, get a pro. If you want to make life easier on yourself, get a laptop that can run Linux. Don't use WSL if you want to be sane and will do any real programming.

I work for a well-known silicon company and our entire development environment is Linux. 

We have developers buy $4k MacBook pros to "SSH" into their build/dev environments.

The way the nanotexture changes the overhead light from white to that pinkish-red is a bit worrisome though, since that suggests if it's doing that to reflections then it's also adding that coloured tint to the screen output as well.

Hi everyone.
I need your opinion regarding my choice of main device for my everyday usage.
My current main device is MacBook Pro M1 and it  has "fallen". Unfortunately just before I could resell it. ( screen turned black and tech guys said the fan is not working too)

 So that aside,
I am planning to go for MacBook Pro 14 Inch M4 base model. USD $1,599.00 on Apple store.

However I am also wondering If it's "wiser" to get either a

13 inch ipadPro base model
USD 1,299.00 on Apple store. 

or 
13‑inch (M3 chip) MacBook air, Base model
$1099 on Apple store.
or the future M4 MacBook Air ? 

Thing about the MacBook Air is that it has no FAN and ...well.. 

What I need them for
1. web graphic design - photoshop-illustrator-Figma
2. programming - doing IOT and perhaps AI soon
3. video editing
4. initially audio/music production.

Another thing is , do you guys agree that we should not wait longer than 3 years from the "launch date of a device", ( in this case, say Windows/Apple ) because the price drop would be huge and we need to take that into consideration if we'd like to to resell our device. 

For a budget of 1000USD what could be my 2nd device ? preferably Windows OS, light for travelling. ( laptop or tablet or 2 in 1 )

Thanks and happy holidays, happy new year!

So the blender benchmark makes me go finally an option that might be worth it vs nvidia windows laptops. I do a lot of 3D and this is competitive against the 4080 laptop and in ray tracing meaning it’s a viable mobile workstation. I never expected it to beat the desktop 4080 or 4090 but it being competitive against the mobile options while using less power and having good battery life might be worth the extra cost.

The fact that we're on the 3rd refresh and the notch is STILL just a pretty okay-ish webcam is so incredibly lame. Save your "bUt tHe sCrEeN iS taLLeR tHoUgH" arguments. It's bad design, period. And the way macOS acts like the notch just isn't there makes it worse. Like a supermodel with a wart on their forehead, except they intentionally chose to have a wart there... it makes no sense to me. I don't know why Apple must always make at least one dumbass design choice on otherwise good devices.

why is that you only cover lenovo, dell and asus laptops now a days. is it that you will only cover the models which are sponsored and the once which you get for free to review(excluding apple, because obliviously apple gets views.) 
Its been so long that you ahve just ignored HP they make quite good premium laptops, but they just do not send you one that often.( apart from omen)
its been 7-8 years since you have covered HP Spectre there most premium device which can easily gives competition to XPS and shitty yoga models which you cover all the time.

Hi Dave, 
I have posted the following query on your other video. But since it has more than 1000 comments, I am not sure, if you would be able to see it. Hence I am messaging you here for a suggesion or opinion on Macbook Battery. 

I have a question about maintaining MacBook battery. My MacBook Pro M4 is about 7 months old and the battery health is 96% in just 7 months. I use the MacBook for about 5-6 hours a day. And it is always connected to power supply. I discharge it (or in other words run the MacBook on battery) once every week where I allow it to go down to 20% to 15% and then charge it back to 100%. I always disconnect the power supply at night and connect it back in the morning. My usage is very light (MS Office, browser, music, Teams, …etc.). I do not use Chrome of any other software. I do not do any heavy work like audio/video processing. 
My question to you is should I change the way I use my MacBook battery to preserve its health so that it can last me for 4-5 years? I have watched your video, and I think I use it the way you would recommend it. But despite that wanted an opinion from an expert like you.
I used Al Dente and despite limiting it to 80%, the battery charges beyond 80%. Usually up to 82% and at times goes to 87%.Then I uninstalled it from MacBook.
