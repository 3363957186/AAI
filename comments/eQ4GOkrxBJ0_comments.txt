I think the freezing is iOS 26 and I feel the same way with the calls breaking up. This is just starting. But I have an iPhone 16 pro max.

    same my sister had the same thing recently she was like hello and she has the iphone 16

Fantastic phone! I only wished there was a Plus model of this one…that would be perfect but also a cannibalism of the Pro lineup!

------------------------------------------------------------

Best phone I've ever used...

    I agree bro, Apple actually cooked with this one 🔥

[9] @MarcoB2K  👍0  2026-02-18
I’ve had the same glitches and phone issues on the 17 Pro as well unfortunately, otherwise the experience has been great.

------------------------------------------------------------

[10] @BoriGiovanni  👍1  2026-02-18
This is my first switch from pro to non pro. I have noticed the following , subtle glitches from apps in the background. Screen shuts off not sure if the camera or lidar isn’t detecting I’m still using my phone but definitely happens often. 
Battery is pretty good 
Weight is nice but still is thick

The base model 17 is the most significant and comprehensive upgrades we've seen in years and I purchased it because I needed a smaller device than my s23 ultra and it's really the perfect all rounder, fashionable and functional.

Keep up the great work Bro

Hey! I thought I was the only one having problems with calls being cut or the other person can't hear me for some moments... wow, so it's an iPhone 17 issue

------------------------------------------------------------

[16] @themikecentral  👍5  2026-02-17
Honestly since the 15 Pro's battery life has slowly been getting way better with the ability to limit charging. I got my Pro last april and I leave it plugged in overnight - yet i still have 100% battery health capacity

------------------------------------------------------------

[17] @FreeBandsTy  👍2  2026-02-17
Apple has been super glitchy lately I got a 19pm and the Notification Center is so glitchy especially when tryna text someone back from the notification bar sometimes the keyboard doesn’t come up or you can type the message but can’t send it , also if you replying to a message in the notification bar and get another notification it kicks you out and you have to open the actual message to reply now

------------------------------------------------------------

[18] @langtaralangneh  👍0  2026-02-17
What I don't like about samsung s series are:
1. Heavy build
2. Low battery capacity
3. No alluminium build
4. Updates system categories

How to say, I have noticed weaker signal when compared to my pixel or my OnePlus, which blew my mind because I thought iPhone had some of the best antennas in the game

    ↳ @bray2079  👍0  2026-02-18
    Android has always had stronger cell antennas. iPhones have never been known for cell reception

[26] @AnhBui-zp1ee  👍0  2026-02-18
ADDICTED?? Bro I don’t think you understand what ADDICTED means. Let me show you what REAL iPhone addiction looks like.
My screen time last month AVERAGED 9 hours and 47 minutes a day. AVERAGED. My peak day hit 14 hours and 23 minutes. On a TUESDAY. I didn’t even have the day off.
The average American spends 5 hours and 16 minutes on their phone per day and health experts say you should cap it at 2 hours. I’m doing TRIPLE the average and 5x the recommended limit. My Screen Time weekly report doesn’t even send notifications anymore. I think it gave up on me.
I use this phone in the bathroom. I use it in the shower. Yes IN the shower, I prop it on the shampoo ledge with a YouTube video playing. I fall asleep with it ON MY FACE and wake up with the screen imprint on my cheek. I use it during every single car ride. I use it while I’m eating breakfast, lunch, AND dinner. I use it while I’m brushing my teeth. I’ve used it while walking into a glass door at Target. TWICE.
My weekly average for February was 68 hours and 29 minutes. That’s almost a full time JOB of just being on my phone. The average person checks their phone 58 times a day. I check mine roughly every 3 minutes I’m awake. My battery cycle count is crying.
You’re ‘addicted’ at 83K subscribers with a Maono mic sponsorship. I’m addicted with no audience, no sponsor, and no excuse. I just genuinely cannot put this phone down. The iPhone 17 is too good. The 120Hz display is too smooth. The camera opens too fast. Apple designed this thing to be digital crack and I am the proof.
5 months later honest review?? Here’s MY honest review: I need an intervention 💀📱

    ↳ @profabrt30  👍0  2026-02-18
    I read all this and I had a good laugh ahaahhaha one question, what is your cycle count and how many days have you had the iPhone 17? I expect a big number on your cycle count bro 😂

------------------------------------------------------------

[27] @vineethv5653  👍0  2026-02-18
I got a problem with my WhatsApp on my ip17 it freezes when I minimise the app while watching a status

------------------------------------------------------------

[28] @friedeyes333  👍0  2026-02-18
Damn. I am waiting on my 17 and in regards to audio dropping on calls, also completely dropped calls, this was the one thing I'd hoped they fixed. I have had issues like this on my old SE and my 16 along with no notification sounds on text and no ringtone on incoming calls and outgoing calls sometimes just register as entered, but it wont ring or connect. This issue does go back a long way. It's documented on the Apple forum and all over Reddit too. 

I was told by an industry insider that there was a bad batch of 16's and their antenna. I have no idea tho if that's true. He's always been a reliable source of info tho. 

Like you said, this could be my WiFi, network or the phone hardware or iOS. I have no idea. Fingers crossed and sorry to hear this is happening to you too. Thank you for a real critical review on it.

I feel you with the glitches thingy. I have my Ip17 for 2 weeks now and we have the same issue. I didn’t upgrade it yet to the latest ios ver yet and the app freezes! like my camera (wont work at time it just blur then will click power button or switch either to video or photo depending on what it was on to make it work again). When scrolling shorts in yt or reels on fb and other stuff sometimes it freezes and one time even clicking the power button wont lock the phone 😂 everything was just frozen~ I just had to wait for a few seconds for it to lock haha didn’t really bothered me since I upgraded from ipX and a very slow android phone…  not a big deal since im very used to laggy phones but now that you mentioned it… yeah it kinda sucks.. i hope they will fix it in their iOS update since it’s more likely ios issue🤧

[32] @benjib7444  👍6  2026-02-17
I like the video. But Apple has to get rid of that glass stuff

    ↳ @aydemirilker4128  👍0  2026-02-17
    You can mostly negate it now. They offer an option to make the glass texture more solid and then you barely notice it.

    ↳ @endorkugo  👍1  2026-02-17
    hell no. i love it. looks clean and sleek. to each their own. you dont  need to use it.

It's so crazy to see Apple users being excited with 10 year old features on phones that are a fifth of a price😅

------------------------------------------------------------

[34] @Juhsentuh  👍20  2026-02-17
$800 is not cheap, iPhone 17 is the most expensive phone I have ever purchased for myself. I have no regrets but I’m not upgrading for years!

    ↳ @alchemY.420  👍1  2026-02-18
    In Canada I spent $1185 for mine lol, I agree with your statement fully lol

    ↳ @ihsotass  👍1  2026-02-18
    who in the f is buying a phone outright in 2026? ive financed all my phones through my carrier for like the past 10 years and upgrade every 2-3 years with a phone bill under 80 dollars...

    ↳ @Justarandomchannel67  👍1  2026-02-18
    Same I had a 13 for 4 years and with the amount of dress I put on it, it was starting to become completely unusable. I saved extra money with a side gig and no regrets so far!

    ↳ @Juhsentuh  👍0  2026-02-18
    @ihsotass Me! I don’t upgrade often and I’m on prepaid. I like my bill being a set amount every month with taxes included. Currently on ATT prepaid unlimited max plan for $55, that’s all I pay and been on the plan for 2 years now. I will never sign up for a postpaid plan again. To much money for a single line.

    ↳ @alchemY.420  👍0  2026-02-18
    @ihsotassI got a decent inheritance settlement so it really wasn’t an issue, but the principle remains I will never spend this much on a phone ever again, I only did so because my daily driver iPhone 7 Plus is too obsolete in 2026 and I am unemployed as of now so financing wasn’t an option.

Noticed the Soundcore Motion X600 bluetooth speaker an upgrade would be a Harmon Kardon Onyx Studio 4 (if you can find one) 👈🏽

I had the app glitching issue with canvas for school. But I thought it was just that specific app. I haven’t noticed it yet on other apps. I’m on the iPhone 16 plus.

    ↳ @bray2079  👍1  2026-02-18
    I think that’s more of an iOS 26 problem. I had similar issues on the 17 pro max

I've never owned a Pro Max phone, and I would love the larger screen. However, the base iPhone 17 is so good now, I don't know which one to get. I feel like I will experience fomo if I get the base iPhone 17. For context i am currently using the iPhone 12 and have been using it since 2020. Any tips/advice?

    ↳ @internetfrnd6496  👍0  2026-02-17
    My 2 cents: the only things youre really missing out on is the extra telephoto, the bigger screen, and bigger battery. If you’re not doing anything too intense on your phone, save some cash and get the base model.

    ↳ @bray2079  👍0  2026-02-18
    I just downsized from the 17 pro max. The phone is heavy and it’s harder to use it one handed .
