And priced same as iphone 17.
And they have ltps screen not ltpo as iphone.
And midrange screen protection gorilla glass 7i 
Whereas the iphone has much better protection with ceramic shield.
And battery life and camera are better on iphone even if it lacks a telephoto.
This is the best value for money iphone ever.
Especially compared to android.
The first time an iphone is priced better than android premium smartphones.

    Original: I can completely understand why you’re saying that, I was on the 14 Pro Max, and I decided to switch to the 17… I’ve had it now for a few days and I have to say, the thing feels like a complete upgrade! Plus it being a bit smaller, and very much lighter, I enjoy that very much… thing feels like a powerhouse, USB-C, my iPhone 14 Pro Max didn’t even have that. As a matter of fact, the 17 has a better screen than the 14 Pro Max. The 17 is a beast.

4. Faster processing chip
5. Enhanced performance to support Apple AI

Original: I find it hilarious how everyone is praising the 17. This would have been a great phone in 2023. It only seems better because Apple controls the narrative on it's products so well. Yes, it's the best base iPhone ever but that's in a class of 1. The only real standout is the selfie camera.
1- lousy usb file transfer speeds
2- iOS 26 still seems to be in beta
3- photo processing tends to an orange tint
It's still a good phone, but let's not go nuts with praise.

I've heard that for videography iphone 17 is better than s24 ultra. Is this true.??

Kindly make a dedicated comparison between iphone 17 vs s24 ultra complete camera comparison and user experience as that's going to be the purchase decision of many folks out
 there.

I am a fan of your work. Thanks

Original: 13 Pro Max users READ THIS

I used the iphone 17 for around 24 hours and the phone is good phone do not get me wrong however coming from a 13 pro max these are the things i will say:

Size: coming from the 13 pro max the size of the of the iphone 17 is noticeable but not that different. I will say if you have been using a smaller phone since forever then by all means this iphone is the best ever for you hands down. If you are a Pro Max user like myself you will definitely get jealous of a 17 Pro Max user once you hold their phone in your hand (this is from experience please trust me). 

Weight: I can tell you for a fact it was such a shock to hold this phone i will not lie to you it is so light compared to a 13 pro max like unimaginable and so unreal its crazy that a phone so light could be so powerful. Having felt the weight of the iphone 17 max as a 13 pro max user i will say it is much more comfortable to use and is lighter to use which is insane. The way i hold my iphone 13 pro max is i have my pinky at the bottom the phone, the finger close to my pinky and middle finger stretched at the edge and then the finger close to my thumb centered around the middle and then i use my thumb to type and its so much easier to do this on 17 pro max

Battery: I have not used an iphone 17 pro max to test battery however from the people i know who has the 17 pro max they say the battery is the best ever and coming from a Pro Max line up i feel you will get extra confidence knowing that your phone is now set for the future in the long run and the upgrade will feel more worth it. Like i said i am speaking to 13 pro max users however the battery on the 17 was just as impressive i will say.

Display: This is bright as hell dude like when i compared it to my 13 pro max it was absolutely noticeable and i love it. When i compared to how snappy it felt from 13 pro max you can tell the difference so i can’t even imagine how nice it is on the 17 pro max. If you are a small phone user you will not be disappointed with the display.

Speakers: This little guy is really really loud i couldn’t begin to tell you how shocked i was when this thing played music it was sick deffo an upgrade.

Dynamic Island: Coming from a 13 pro max we don’t get this luxury and for a few extra bucks i would say its worth having compared to what we get on the 13 pro max. 

Camera control & Action Button: i personally like these new features so getting this on either phone is just a plus dude especially coming from a phone that doesn’t have them.

Selfie Camera and Camera: Wow lets just say game changer from 13 pro max its astounding definitely an upgrade which either one you go for

Future Planning: i feel like the 12gb gives me a safer or confidence booster that if i don’t upgrade in the next year or 2 years that the phone will be equipped for any future software upgrade or AI upgrades so thats something u will need to take into consideration however if you are a casual user it won’t matter.


All in all if you are 13 Pro Max user please do not make of going for the base 17. Yes you get a ton of upgrades but you will miss that screen and i feel like just get added bonuses for the screen which is why i am returning it

SMALL PHONE USERS - Best ever phone you can get a hold of right now.

It’s the first time I have used it to record out playing and I am very happy about the recording quality and the play back on the phones speakers.. it’s very good .. much clearer and more detail. Plus that extra memory shows me to hold soo many more recordings.. I got very disillusioned with some on ios18 but I have to say I am glad I took my friend’s advice and stayed with Apple.. I hate the Mac.. don’t get me started… but the phone and ios26 I really like . Very happy

Original: One thing I noticed is when watching a video, is sounds like I’m playing it through a TV. The sound quality is amazing! But, I also just upgraded to the 17 from an XR, so maybe it has been like this 😅

    Original: @allmypicturesofu Everything runs so much better on the 17. The swiping, videos, and all are smooth. Battery has no issues lasting all day for me. Just a better overall experience than my XR that was on its last leg lol
