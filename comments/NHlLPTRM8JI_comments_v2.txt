Original: Correction: The power brick is not missing because of the EU.
Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.79)

Original: Correction: 

The 70W Power Adapter is not included anymore in the box.  But the price has been reduced to reflect this. (The price has been lowered with the exact cost of the 70W power adapter). 

The MagSafe cable is still included with the MacBook Pro 14-inch M5.
Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.89)

[3] ❌ @watchcommander2012  👍0  2025-10-29
Original: I sick of every review trying to justify Apple removing the Power Adapter due to EU regulations coming next year. This is the UK we had a little thing called brexit EU rules do not apply to us and now this model is more expensive by £59.00 in UK. So Apple lied it’s not the same price as before!

    ↳ ➖ @samlawrence4670  👍4  2025-10-21
    Original: If you take the 20% vat off the uk pice it’s £1280 before tax with current exchange rates that makes it $1711 which is about 6.9% more than the pre tax American price. Add the cost of the power brick and it’s almost 15% though.

    ↳ ➖ @Psychofunks  👍0  2025-10-21

    Original: That is due to the pound falling against the dollar. Compared to Oct 2024, Apple would get £60 less per £2000 in Oct 2025. With the likelihood of further falls due to the upcoming budget, it is no surprise Apple has added the £100 back on.

Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.85)

------------------------------------------------------------

[17] ✅ @Tonicwave2  👍0  2025-10-22
Original: What I really like about this chip is that it advances Macbook Pros at an affordable price point.  If you don't want to pay full retail, there is a big secondary market of M2 to M4 Macbooks of Air, Pro 14 and Pro 16 models for you to find an affordable Macbook for your needs. 

I feel that if you have an M1, you can still wait to upgrade but that it is a big jump if you choose to. I have an M1 Max/32GB/1TB I paid $3200 for. I can get an M5 Macbook Pro with the same RAM, 50% faster CPU in both single and multi, and twice the storage for 30% cheaper.  I won't upgrade, but I think it is a fair (and tempting) choice.
Sentiment: positive (confidence 0.91)

    ↳ ✅ @calvin2032  👍1  2025-11-06
    Original: I’ve seen a video of it. The M4 Pro beats out the M5 in most every category. The M5 did have considerably more battery life after 3 hours of stress testing for benchmarks. At the non discounted price it was tougher to recommend the M4 Pro for the average user, but given some of the sale prices he suggested going with it. He was excited to see what the M5 Pro would do.

[20] ➖ @Vic-lacoix  👍0  2025-12-21
Original: I am wrestling with this question: Will rising RAM prices push the Spring 2026 M5 MacBook Air (32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD) close enough to today’s M5 MacBook Pro (32 GB, 1 TB) EU price that buying the Pro now is the better choice than waiting?

    ↳ ❌ @theothernodude3139  👍1  2025-10-22
    Original: Dual screen is gimmicky, at least compared to the MacBook Pro''s studio grade display. Doesn't get as bright and no nano texture, worse speakers, slower performance, worse battery life, slower SSD speeds. Lord knows how it'll hold up in 5, 10 years time when the M1 MacBook Airs and Pros with 8GB from 2020/2021 both handle the new OS nicely and will receive future updates. 

But I mean hey, if you're into two infused screens just to tell others and yourself that you're built different instead of just buying an external display, Zenbook definitely has the upper leg.

    ↳ ➖ @andyH_England  👍1  2025-10-22
    Original: The Law comes into force in April 2026, and the directive is that OEMs are not allowed to include the charger in the box on the order page. You can then add the charger, and to reward those who care about e-waste, they charge less for no charger, and there is a cost if you want to add a charger. This is not on Apple, and all OEMs will have to do this; otherwise, they will face fines and a ban.

Original: I think it's fantastic that you no longer have to buy the crappy, bulky Apple power adapters. MacBooks without power adapters have become €100 cheaper in Germany. For that money, you can buy high-quality power adapters from Anker or other brands. Win win. If you don't need it you save a lot of money, if you do need it you can buy a much better power supply for the same price or less.

Original: You missed one of the most important differences. M5 MacBook Pro is an absolute battery champ - up to 24h of use. This is probably one of the main reasons to go for it. For someone that needs bright screen and best battery and doesn’t need the best performance – doesn’t get any better than this. Also worth mentioning M5 is faster than M1 Pro.

    Sentiment: neutral (confidence 0.61)

    ↳  @pashnfrmusc  👍0  2025-10-27
    Original: @pruserin - So, I subscribed to the AppleCare+ one option that covers 3 devices, and I felt that that's a good deal because I have 3 devices, and it's cheaper that way. As far as choosing the Air, it's the better option for my personal needs because I don't need all the extra features that a Pro offers. I still have my 2018 Pro (because it still works), but new software upgrades are no longer supported.

    ↳ ✅ @m.z.9411  👍0  2025-10-31
    Original: @pruserin Apple care is worth it if you bring it out all the time, store it in the backpack or study/work in shared office/cafe..avoid those accident. I am still on my m1 pro 16inch.. don't see much reason to upgrade. But going from 2018, the m4 is more than enough for anyone non professional.

Most of the time I'm on Claude Desktop/Code or ChatGPT anyways. Code compilation is superbly fast already. So yeah, good specs for the M5 Pro but an Air M4 is just a no brainer from a cost to performance ratio.

How can  the 14" have 70wh with fan, yet 15" without fan has just 66wh

We need 90wh in 15" or M5 in 16" with 100wh

    Original: The EU requires OEMs not to include the charger in the PC sale, but they can offer it as an extra, similar to more storage or RAM, and, like those, you have to pay for it. The logic of not charging for a charger is counterproductive, as consumers will ask for one if it is free, and that does not stop e-waste.

The M5 Pro base model should have started with at least a 12-19 Core CPU, 1TB SSD, Wi-Fi 7, 160hz refresh rate and 32GB RAM. There's no point in upgrading from the M2, M3 or M4 at this point.

Original: The value prop depends on how you spec it. The higher you go up, the more sense the Pro makes. For example, if you want a unit with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, there is only a $200 USD difference. That is more than justified by the Pro's several hours of additional battery life, superior display, expanded port selection, and better speakers. That's before you even get into the performance deltas between the two SoCs. And the Pro has active cooling if needed, while the Air will just throttle. The 15" Air and the 14" Pro also weight very similarly-- 1.51 kg versus 1.55 kg.

Games are default to run on Direct X and X86.    Apple runs on Metal and ARM.    most gaming PC’s and even all of the handheld PC’s uses X86 architecture.    So honestly, it’s the game developers not Apple.

    Original: @ThetechchapI ditched my M2 MacBook Pro 14” and just took delivery of 13” M4 MacBook Air ( 24gb RAM and 512gb SSD ) and everything I have thrown at this in the last couple of days it has outperformed the pro. That’s Final Cut Pro X edits and rendering, live streaming AND air drop performance. I would say that this spec Air is the most powerful laptop you can buy for £1250 and in 90% of use cases will keep up with a pro machine and anyone doing that 10% that this won’t work with will likely understand that already and wouldn’t even consider the Air. 

I think your comparison here is actually VERY important for average consumers and business consumers as how many people buy a pro because they think they need it when in fact they absolutely do not… Great video.

Original: For me the biggest surprise was that there is FINALLY base model what is 512 GB, not only 256 GB. I have couple of years old MBA and that 256 GB what I bought somehow just feels so limited and absurd nowadays. Like c'mon, any software you install it immediately takes huge amounts of space (Logic Pro X + some plugins), then if you want to use it on anything with photos and/or videos and/or music production the disk space is almost full very quickly. 

It just feels insane how long we have had this 256 GB as a base model when even cellphones have so much space on base models.

And yeah of course, it is my own fault that I was naive to buy 256 GB model thinking it is good enough. Well, it has been good enough because I have not used it that much :D If there would be more space internally I probably might use it more for Lightroom Classic and so on, but now I always go for Windows PC and use Mac only on very light usage.

Obviously, Apple cannot accept that, as other OEMs would not, so we do not get the £100 discount for not having an included charger.

Because I am was an ASUS user, okay it is running in the background, and New to the MacBook arena, I decided on a Sky Blue 13" MacBook Air M4, which I got for a Christmas present.  Binge watching and checking if the present I bought my sister for her birthday / Christmas / work present was the MacBook Pro M4 14" because her old Intel MacBook Pro didn't have the MagSafe.

I'm finding that I type fast and was literally no adjustment to the typing, but the shortcuts which was my favorite on Windows products, but this will be a learning curve, and a challenge to learn it as fast as possible, before I start studying computer science.  And don't tell me, being older makes this a problem, I love a challenge and would strive and thrive to better than the children, as life experiences has taught me studying anything, you should want to prove something to yourself and want to learn that field for your betterment.  Luckily I'm not technologically stinted.

The question would be, what will I struggle with on the base M4 Air.

Original: Apple fail of the day:  3 hours on the phone with Apple customer disservice.   Operatorsr are either incompetent and reading large files while you wait, or they are agitators who answer questions with answers that have nothing to do with your question.  Escalating to a "senior advisor" gets spanish males who don't understand that there is a left mouse button and a right mouse button and will tell you, "it doesn't matter which mouse button you use...  press control and click."  This is how incompetent even "senior advisors" are at Apple today.  Apple tech support can not help you any more.  You will be on the phones for hours; you will be hung up on; they will not call you back;  when you ask why they didn't you will get a black agitator female who says, "you are yelling at me and I feel like you are talking to me like a child".   These are pathetic people who don't understand customer service; hang up on you if they think they can't help; don't call you back; and get annoyed that you spend hours on the phone and sit there for long periods of time while they, "read support articles" trying to train themselves on the phones.  Tim Cook needs to be fired;  demolish the gay rainbow (priorities are all screwed up.. start with the basics and maybe you can save Apple from falling like Rome);  all these incompetent affirmative action/DEI moron hires fired; and start all over again.

Original: The difference between the mid spec MBA 512 and the MacBook Pro M5 entry is about $400 for that you get a much better screen better battery, faster USB ports, improved memory and better sound. If people are keeping their computers for 3+ years or more why would you go to the MacBook Air it makes absolutely no sense. If you amortize 400 dollars over even three years it’s literally 11 dollars a month, plus your resale value will be a little better. Get the air if you fly all the time and use your computer on the aircraft. But otherwise I think the argument should be why the MBA. FWIW I have the m1 MBA and it’s great !

Yeah they are getting into the cpu market because they don’t want apples Arm and Qualcomm’s arm chips to take over plus trump let these tech companies go wild. Less regulation and tax cuts for making chips here. 

Most of Nvidias revenue is still going to server GPU’s no doubt. I mean they are the largest company by revenue but it’s not because their gaming and creator GPU’s.

    Original: @alanmay7929The bandwidth speed of a 5090 mobile will most likely be taken by the bandwidth speed of the M5 max or it’ll be similar.

The problem with a theoretical M5 ultra is the infinity link between two M5 max’s. It doesn’t scale up well. Now if a M5 ultra was a single chip then it’ll take a 5090 in some areas but those cuda cores are monsters.

Needing an MBP over an Air is nowadays more about a better display for creatives, SD card slot and more ports., avoiding the need for docks and adapters while on the move.

Original: The EU regulations sure do know how to bend us over, so that our politicians can virtue signal how clean they're in their heads while the rest of the world continues absolutely ravaging the environment further. The state of EU is insane as we're paying more for less, we're destroying our car manufacturers, we're even trying to shut down our farmers to "reduce" CO2 emissions and import food from China at 5x the CO2 and without a doubt some serious potential to compromise our health while our healthcare is falling behind at an astonishing rate at the same time. Luckily farmers managed to stand against tax cuts being taken away from them this time, but how long until some lunatics try forcing that again? Meanwhile, China is flooding us with subsidized cheap garbage of products (cars, for example) to fill in the gap with an order of magnitude higher CO2 emissions than if we were to produce what we need ourselves. Got a bit off topic there, but it's very much relevant with how we need to cash out more for chargers as if not including them is gonna make any difference to the environment anyway. Manufacturers are sure happy about it as they definitely won't be selling phones and laptops at a lower price due to the absence of a charger.

Backpack weight adds up quickly for an art student. But I'm not sure if she'll be limited by throttling. She'll be using the Adobe Creative suite mostly and Toon Boom 3D animation program. Is the Air a good investment or should I just forget and jump to the Pro? Also, is the 13,6" Air sufficient for PS/AI stuff considering she also has the iPad Pro tablet (I think 12.5") that she'll be using with the Sidecar feature as a second screen so she can actually use her pencil?

I really don't see who's going to need more than this except 3D animation professionals, etc... The overall value just went up.  Notable increase in disk performance - very under appreciated.  Substantial increase in memory performance.  And some next-gen features on the CPU/GPU that bump it up into aaa gaming territory.

Original: Corrections/Opinions:
1 - the MiniLED/OLED graphics thing. (already mentioned by others)
2 - You said for the 96W power adaptor it was £70 extra, when the video [2:02] clearly says £79.
3 - The MBA speed graphics [8:30] shows it has much faster Write than Read speeds - 50% faster!  I've never seen storage that is much faster write than read (if at all). If it's true, then my bad.
4 - The position of the two laptops keeps changing in the video. For the viewer, sometime the MBP M5 is on the left and then it cuts to another scene where the MBP M5 is now on the right, and then it cuts to another scene, where it's back on the left, etc. keep some consistency please - just so the viewer doesn't get confused which way round they are, especially when there's suddenly spec graphics/text on them.
5 - You are using way more expensive models that the base models. e.g. having 1TB storage each, 32GB RAM in the MBP, MBP nano-texture, etc. but then you casually say to the viewer [8:42] £1K for the MBA and £1.6K for the MBP. That's the base model prices, not the ones you're showing/using. It's always worth telling the viewer the cost of the macbooks you're actually using as well, so they don't think they can get all the stuff/specs you were showing for the last 8 minutes for just £1K or £1.6K. That should be much clearer.

Feels like a bit of a rush job video without the usual quality checks beforehand. Otherwise, keep up the good work. Thanks.

    Original: Yeah. And the cable thing is also wrong. Apple still ships a Magsafe cable. The only thing which is not included anymore is the power adapter.  But its also cheaper, which makes it possible to choose if you want the 65w or the bigger one or you dont need one because you have one. Me for instance I have power adapters and especially since i mostly use a 85w Dockingstation, i never really needed another one. So, getting the option to having it cheaper but without a power adapter is quite neat. And as i said, the Magsafe cable is still in the box.

Original: 1. It has no Wi-Fi 7, no Thunderbolt 5, and no Bluetooth 5.4 or 6. It's outdated already. Honestly, it's a dinosaur without Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 5. 

2. The EU and UK have become autocratic dictators over the corporations that do business in their countries. They are also taxing the living hell out of American companies like Apple. You are paying the price for voting for and electing extreme-left nutcase leaders like Keir Starmer and his political ilk. Hang on to your wallet, because paying for a charging brick is just the start. American companies are going to pass the cost of doing business in the draconian taxing EU and UK to YOU.

3. UK citizens have lost their right of free speech. Your radically left government is sending armed police to arrest and charge 33 people a day in your country for posting non-violent tweets that criticize Starmer and his leftist cohorts. They are sentencing these people to MINIMUM sentences of 2 years, though some lesser sentences are imposed in some cases. Yes, that's right, your government is putting over 12,000 people a year IN JAIL for posting information critical of your government that is NON-VIOLENT!

4. You have lost your rights to peacefully protest in the UK. The Starmer government is arresting political opponents and protesters and sentencing them to multi-year prison terms for NON-VIOLENT protests.

5. You've lost your right to freedom of religion. The UK government is charging people in your nation for praying SILENTLY for women getting abortions outside of abortion clinics on public streets. Yes, that's right, your dystopian dictators are arresting UK citizens for praying SILENTLY in public. A decorated military veteran was just arrested for this "crime."

In summary, the UK has become an excrement-filled, third-world totalitarian dictatorship, and most of the UK citizens are too damn stupid and politically illiterate to understand that the government has taken priceless civil rights freedoms away from them. It's like boiling a frog slowly. If you boil the frog very slowly, it will never realize it is in danger and jump out of the pot. Similarly, if you slowly and secretly take away citizens' "unalienable rights" from them, most of the uneducated, mentally lazy, politically illiterate citizens don't have a clue that they are losing precious freedoms forever and descending into a 1984 dystopian dictatorship.

Original: Well to be fair, you can for many usecases get away with 16GB of unified memory for many AI workloads.
you can run many distilled and quantized models that fit into memory just fine.

Sure, more memory allow you to run larger models without triggering swap.
But for a lot of people it's really not needed. 
There's also quite a lot of good LLM's that will run just fine on 16GB of unified memory.

However I agree that if you feel the need to run the biggest and best models without any quantization yeah you will probably need more like 64-128GB.
But I would not recommend this for the general hobbyist. This is something I would recommend if you have a business need for it, if you need the very best accuracy. 

Other use cases I can see for having loads of memory would be perhaps if you are an artist/composer making huge music projects that loads a large number of sample based virtual instruments. For example orchestral work. some of these sample libraries can be absolutely huge.
(that being said, you should get quite far with 32GB of memory)

What made it a no-brainer for me to get this computer is that it is actively cooled and has neural accelerators which dramatically increase AI workload performance.
When running heavy workloads for and extended period of time a MacBook Air would thermal throttle.
So waiting for an M5 MacBook Air is not interesting for me.
And the more expensive models are simply too expensive for me, I don't think it's worth it unless I earn money using the computer (which I don't)
