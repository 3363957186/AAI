[2] ❌ @akinyinkajohnson5332  👍16  2025-09-22
原文：Got the flolab one, but the fit on the 17 was odd, using the installer places the screen protector a bit high up on the phone so there’s a bit of a pronounced gap between the base of the screen and the start of the screen protector

原文：Flolab have been really lacking with their shipping and support. I've read reviews about their shipping speed and it's been horrible. Ordered 1 week ago and still no updates, no tracking, just ordered being processed. I can't even use my iPhone 17 pro.

------------------------------------------------------------

[11] ❌ @bobgolfs4432  👍0  2026-01-13
原文：I didn’t have the best of experiences with the Flolab.  First, I did have to work on many bubbles and one small one that initially did not go away.  Eventually, I got it worked out but I guess i expected more considering the price.  But my real concern, or warning for others is compatibility with phone cases.  When I installed the case I had purchased for my new IPhone 17 (not the pro or Pro max), it caused the sides of the screen protector to raise and ultimately most of the protector separated from the screen.  I quickly removed the case but as a result, the screen protector shifted and I had to reinstall it by sight.  That wasn’t easy.  Nonetheless, I still managed to encounter some dust and have not been able to dislodge it.  Again,  I am commenting primarily as a warning.   Ultimately, I purchased a Spigen case recommended in a sister video to this and that appears to be compatible.

[12] ✅ @michaelbruno5075  👍33  2025-09-20
原文：I don't comment a lot on channels, However I will say that I purchased the iPhone 16 pro max version last year and it saved my bacon. I had dropped my phone and when I picked it up this past week, I had thought I cracked the screen right before my trade-in. This saved me big time. It was the best $40 I spent, considering a replacement front glass for the iPhone would have been around $379,  with no Apple care. I just purchased another for my iPhone 17 Pro Max.

原文：@MobileReviewsEh Hi, just wanna ask if those screen protectors with black edges blocks some portion of the screen?  Because from my experience with the 17 pro max some brands with black edges covers small portions of the screen making it look like it has bigger bezels. Thanks.

原文：Apple has invested tens of money for R&D its iPhone glass .... then one of those cheap "screen protectors" made in China Covered all Apple's efforts!       LMAO!

Apple has invested $2.5 billion in a new partnership with Corning to develop and produce future iPhone cover glass, which includes a new Innovation Center focused on material and manufacturing advancements. This is a specific investment for future R&D and manufacturing, not the total annual R&D spending for all iPhone components, which was in the tens of billions of dollars. Previous investments in Corning for R&D include an additional $250 million in 2019 and $45 million in 2021.

原文：I haven’t used a screen protector for at least 10 years without getting any scratches. I am careful with my phone, and I keep it clean. I’m not severely hard on my phone, but I carry it everywhere with me. For me, and I guess for many people, screen protectors aren’t necessary. The glass on modern devices has been excellent for years. Comments show that screen protector adverts work.

原文：Thank you. I just now ordered the Flo Lab from Amazon through your link. The price for the screen that fits the iPhone 17 ProMax is $49.95. It will be here in two days and it sounds much better than the cheap $8 screen I ordered a few weeks back, but haven't installed. As for phone case, I use external lens attached to the iPhone, thus have to use the lens manufacturer's case because it contains the lens mounts. Bah humbug!

原文：I don't take care of my phone much and I removed the screen protector on my 13 pro max instantly. I thought why not use the phone I payed for and it was much more satisfying, I really hated the feel of the protector. After 4 years I only got a very minor scratch which isn't even noticable as it's not deep and is only like 2mm. So now I don't know if i should try one on my 17 pro max.

原文：Bought the Wsken for 17/16 Pro, and the top of the screen stays with air bubbles, no matter how many times i press to get rid them, thay always come back, and it doesnt have a grill or speaker cutout. so it covers the speaker of the iphone, wich may interfere with sound. 
More negative reviews in amazon, pin point these design flaws, that should not be ignored when doing a review.

Front facing mic by the camera also held with noise cancellation when using speaker phone.  If you cover this with glass you will be muffled to everyone you talk too.

I thought I messed up the first one so o was dumb and bought a second one and waited another 2 weeks. Same result: doesn’t stick well and has tons of bubbles. Read actual customer reviews and you’ll get a realistic picture. Kinda makes me resent YouTube guys like this who seem transparent with their testing but are obviously getting some return from the company.

They said the equivalent of “too bad so sad" if you don't have the traxking number. I gave them a copy of a post office charge, but I could not find a copy of a tracking number.  am not trying to get a refund, only a case that fits my phone.

I watched the instruction videos and used the plastic tray for alignment but somehow had air under the screen near the top and top edge that I couldn’t remove with the little tool (squeegee). Paid almost €40 incl delivery, so didn’t expect this. I reached out to support, who were very friendly & helpful, and they will send me a new kit.

原文：I really wanted to go with flowlabs but rhey don’t make a 3D edge version yet for the 17 series except for the privacy version. I emailed them about it and they confirmed. From my experience have the earlier versions of the Flolab for the 16 pro max, they did fit well until they released their 3D edge version. It took them 3 versions to get it right. The 3D edge version fit perfectly. I’m baffled why they didn’t release that for the 17 series as the screen geometry is the same. I bought the Torras because it had that perfect edge to edge rounded edge fit.  But as your testing showed its AR is not as good and it locks the polarspectra feature which I love. Why Flolab?! What was the edge and fit like on the one you tested?

I plan to get a new phone , the iPhone 17 pro, and they don’t even have it available on Amazon for that model first of all, and second even for the 16 pm there’s mixed reviews. Not sure how I feel about this one. I typically use magic john screen protectors cuz of the application design, and durability. I just want an explanation for the mixed reviews on Amazon frfr.

    原文：I have one on my phone right now and I love it! It’s way easier on my eyes and I sleep better. I got the privacy one and it’s not annoying. The red light filter on it is not aggressive ( it looks clear and you only see the red in direct sunlight and the privacy filter on the sides) either and to me it’s a relief because the last time I tried a blue light filter on my device it was literally just a blue tinted glass . I only have three huge scratches on mine and I have a Luckycoin crossbody leather case and they work well with each other. I would highly recommend it if you use your phone at night, it’s pricey but I enjoy mine immensely especially since I was disappointed with my last screen protector experience with wsken

I’m wondering if they use the same protector as last year, although the dimensions for the new phone are not exactly the same. I don’t remember having this problem with previous Flolabs.. 🤷‍♂️

I used the "updated" ONETIME PRO Anti Reflective PolarSpectra 3D Infinity Edge for well over 4 months and it was decent but I don't get it how is it possible to be so incapable of manufacturing a screen protector that doesn't obstruct pixels. Torras might be easier to crack but the coverage is excellent and it doesn't obstruct the screen visibility. Also the anti reflexiveness looks better to my eyes. Flolab has a weird bluish tint when direct light hits the screen.

figured out you can take a piece of acetate (or a cheep glass screen protector if you feel fancy)  and stick a GEL anti glare screen protector on it  
IT HAS TO BE A GEL ONE (you can buy huge sheets for cheep)
you then have a removable and infinitely  reusable anti glare screen protector that sticks to your phone screen so you can still have a nice bright screen at home, but privacy outside
after about a week you figure out how to install it bubble free in about 5 seconds 
still works with no loss of responsiveness even with a standard screen protector already installed

原文：I’m disappointed with the scratch resistance of the FloLab screen protector. Despite the high price point, mine sustained a deep scratch just from being in a pocket with a metal money clip. Since FloLab doesn’t cover physical wear under their warranty, I’m left with a damaged screen and a lighter wallet. At $40, I don’t feel the value matches the durability; there are much more affordable options that perform similarly.

    原文：I bought the UltraGlass Unbreak for my 17 Pro Max based on that same video and I would say hold off for now. It’s so close to being great but 2/2 of the screen protectors have noticeable air bubbles on the right side outer-most edge of the screen. Like literally in the exact same spot both times I installed them. Also small air bubbles in either of the bottom corners. I followed their instructions and used the tool, but somehow it happened twice. My guess is that the installation tool and/or screen protector needs to be updated for the new phone. That, or their adhesive needs to improve.

Now I’m looking at the Torras OrigArmor since the Flolab is gonna get here by the end of October.

原文：Got the torras and the thing had dust under it before install making it an extremely frustrating thing to put on because I had to use duct tape to clean its backside off after peeling it half off again. Anyway I was/am really happy with the look and feel but it just shattered on the corner in my pocket with a case on completely randomly. Not really sure what happened there but for such an expensive screen I won’t be buying this one again. Honestly just gonna either go with an actual sapphire screen or a cheap matte one.

原文：While I do appreciate the value of knowing how tough the glass is, how well the AR works, etc., what I think is equally important is the ease of installation of the actual screen protectors. I have tried the flolab ones on my previous phones, but this new method of application for the OrigArmor series takes the cake for me. Cant tell you how many screen protectors i’ve wasted trying to have a dust and bubble free screen. Maybe it’s just me, but this new torras one was just so much easier to apply without any issues.

原文：I used the glassgo on my iphone 16 pro max and torras case. dropped it a lot and changed screen protectors twice in a year. Sadly, the back cracked sometime and noticed it today. Decided to order the 17 pro, not the max, due to this issue (no applecare+) and that they actually greatly upgraded the telephoto camera on the iphone 17 pro. I don't care about the max having a bit more screen space and battery life at this point.

I'll sell the iphone 16 pro max with a cracked back. Sure, compared to just repairing it, I'd shell out 400 bucks more but I get the new camera, a supposedly sturdier back glass and I honestly think I'm tired of the max versions, I have the biggest ipad pro so if I truly want to watch a lot of videos, I'll use that, I rarely watch anything on the go.

I'd say the glassgo was fine on its own, even when it shattered after many drops on hard surfaces my iphone had zero scratches, but supposedly the origarmor has the benefits of curved edges and less glare so I want to test it. Kinda expensive, really, you get 2 glassgo versions with pretty much the same glass except the glare reduction and edges for a lower price than one origarmor. But I suppose it's fun to test out.

Was looking at flolab too but they seem to have deceptive warranty and it'll likely be annoying to get help in the EU. But, really, torras doesn't offer warranty at all. But I was buying my case from them anyway. Meh. Maybe I should've went with the standard one instead, far more economic, I'll see if it's truly worth it.

原文：Got the flolab because of this review. I got the privacy screen protector, and its subpar. I’ve dropped it twice and it cracked after second time. I dropped my previous iphone 13 hundreds of times and never had to get my screen replaced. I dropped this one twice and already need a replacement. Honestly should recalibrate the review, also include Belkin kuz thats what apple is offering in store as well. The privacy screen is not that great as you can still see significantly from the sides at full brightness, and thats what i didn’t wanna have to compromise. Considering it does dull the display a bit. Im happy they offer a replacement but its a $10 shipping charge every time, so after 4 times you’re better off buying a new one. My sister got the belkin one and its pitch back on the side with much better display clarity. Will be getting the belkin one instead. Not sure if its super different that the non-privacy screen one, but from my experience not worth it

原文：I bought Flolab screen protected because of your review around 4 years ago, and I watched your whole video and all testing you've completed and I've been blown away! Like WOW. And it was all true: That Flolab screen protector based off your recommendation lasted me for a long time and I never replaced that first one and it was just amazing experience. Very nice touch, I like how it interacted with water drops etc.

I continue to get Flolab screen protectors and only had that one all of these 4 years but the thing is - they started to break a lot easier than before. And yes they do cover it with a warranty which costs me like $11 to replace it, and so now I am realizing - it's very much possible that they're up to something: or maybe I am dropping my phone much more... At the same time it's nice to have an insurance for the screen protector. 

Regardless of that I still have to go with a Flolab and probably because I just haven't seen anything better.

I followed the instructions and cleaned the phone thoroughly. I’m giving it another chance because it looks and feels great, so I just ordered two more for my new iPhones 16 and 17. Hopefully, a brand-new iPhone screen will provide a better surface for the Flolab to adhere to across 100% of its area..

I have a question; I’ve been using Flolab screen protectors for years now, they are much better than any other I’ve tried. 

However, they always start to bubble at the top of the screen after 1-2 months, why is this happening? (iPhone user)

I always install it in a dust free clean room, wash my hands before installing and follow the installation video to every step.

Flolab always replaces it, but it is quite expensive to pay for shipping almost every month.

In this way, I cannot really compare. i mean, maybe the 6th in the list was just 5% worst than the 5th, but I cannot know this way.

原文：I was hoping it wasn't going to be the Flolab.. lol.. primarily because the USPS halted their shipment to me on the 20th and just today updated that they consider it "Postal Service property under USPS regulations" due to "counterfeit postage." I originally reached out to their support when I got the first update on the 20th and they told me following day that the "USPS service provider system is experiencing a malfunction." and that "Upon checking, I see that your order is currently in transit." The image they placed in their reply was from their side and not the USPS tracking number. I've reached out to them again, but haven't heard anything back yet. Can get you screenshots if you want to use in another video, etc. I hope they make it right. I was happy with last year's screen protector on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. Sadly, my shiny new orange boi is still hanging out  in the box because the protector hasn't arrived. I'm one of those weirdos who likes to unbox and immediately apply the screen protector before I begin using my new phone.

    原文：I got the new ESR screen protector (the one produced by Corning) for the iPhone pro and unfortunately had to return it. I’ve had the protector on for two days in my pocket which only had a few Bic pens for work and there is already misting scratches by the camera. Really disappointed with ESR on this one. Gonna pay a little more to get the Flolab Nanoarmor, let’s see what happens.

I've watched your reviews for years.  Going back to when I got a case for my Xr in about 2018. You recommended the mous case and it protected my phone perfectly through A LOT of drops. 
I just got a 17 and ordered the mous case again based on your review. And guess what - I'm about to order your #1 rated screen protector. Thanks!!!

Screen protectors is not a thing to go cheap on. You want the absolute best one.

I just bought the one with privacy after watching your review and took the bite of $60 CAD using your discount code. (It still works!)

Harder to apply than much cheaper protectors that performed better for me in the past. Keep gettin bubbles and i could not get rid of them. The glare is still very noticeable. I would not recommend this and i have asked for my money back and want to seem the extra one back. The best anti reflective protectors are the Matt ones. I bought a very good one for 16 dollars for my old phone. Excellent anti reflective effect, no finger prints, very smooth surface and durable.

It cracked in the first week, and had edge damage by the second week.  After 3 weeks it's completely unusable with shards coming off the edge on the bottom every time I swipe up. Their warranty isn't worth it when you still have to pay $10 per replacement for shipping. Easily the worst screen protector and most expensive I've ever used.

I instantly went to check out your #1 ranked screen protector I believe last year and this year (or at least mentioned in multiple cideos as the best one by far) Do you have any thoughts on why this is rated so low on amazon? There are so many people complaining about it. 

The ihpone 16 version on amazon is currently rated at a 3.3 which is pretty abysmal even by screen protector standards.

Plus there are air bubbles in the middle. I've come to the conclusion that the back plate might not be completely flat. When watching a YouTube video where a guy tested several types, the full coverage glass protector for the rear that he used (a different manufacturer from the two I tried), his also wasn't sticking along the top and bottom with air bubbles in the middle.

Having a website with actual detailed results of every screen protector you have tested would be much more useful than just saying hey here is 3 buy them all through my link. You keep saying you are a reviewer not an influencer, but your "reviews" are done very influencer like where you are not actually tracking any detailed results outside of sharing your AFFILIATE  links. Which is just as bad as being an influencer.
